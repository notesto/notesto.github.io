        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-196-REVIEW"><a href="#STEP-196-REVIEW" class="headerlink" title="STEP 196 REVIEW"></a>STEP 196 REVIEW</h2><p>Today review the past two weeks of preparation. Read each day’s instructions and then review your experience of practice for that day. Begin with the first day in the two-week period, and follow each day step by step. You will now begin to review your preparation in two-week intervals. This is given you to do now because your perception and comprehension are beginning to bud and to grow. </p><p>今天回顾过去两周的准备工作。阅读每天的说明，然后回顾当天的练习经历。从两周内的第一天开始，每天按部就班。现在，你将开始以两周为间隔回顾你的准备工作。现在让你这样做，是因为你的感知力和理解力开始萌芽和成长。</p><p>Remember each day. Try to recall your practice and experience. The lessons themselves will recall this experience to you if you have forgotten. Try to see the progression of learning so that you may understand how to learn. Try to see that which confirms Knowledge and that which denies Knowledge within yourself so that you may learn to work with these tendencies. </p><p>记住每一天。试着回忆你的练习和经历。如果你忘记了，课程本身会让你回忆起这些经历。试着看清学习的进程，这样你就会理解如何学习。试着看清自己内心对内识的肯定和否定，从而学会与这些倾向合作。</p><p>Becoming a true student of Knowledge will require greater self-discipline, greater consistency of application and greater acceptance of worth than anything you have undertaken thus far. Following prepares you to become a leader, for all great leaders are great followers. If the source of your leadership represents goodness and truth, then you surely must learn to follow it. And to follow it, you must learn how to learn of it, how to receive it and how to give it.</p><p>要成为一名真实的内识学生，你需要比以往任何时候都更加自律、更加坚持不懈地运用内识、更加认同内识的价值。追随让你做好成为领导者的准备，因为所有伟大的领导者都是伟大的追随者。如果你的领导力来源代表着善良和真理，那你就必须学会追随它。为了追随它，你必须学会如何学习它、如何接收它以及如何给予它。</p><p>Let your long review time today, which may exceed two hours of involvement, be a review of the past two weeks, keeping all of these things in mind. Become objective about your life. There is no condemnation that is necessary here, for you are learning to learn, you are learning to follow and you are learning to employ Knowledge, as Knowledge will certainly employ you. Here Knowledge and you come together in true matrimony and in true harmony. Then Knowledge is more powerful, and you are more powerful. There is no inequality here, and all things find their natural course of expression.</p><p>今天的回顾时间可能会超过两个小时，让我们在回顾过去两周的工作时，牢记所有这些事情。客观地看待自己的生命。在这里，没有必要谴责，因为你正在学会学习，学会追随，学会运用内识，因为内识一定会运用你。在这里，内识和你是真实结合的，真实的和谐。内识更加强大，你也更加强大。这里没有不平等，万事万物都能找到自己自然的表达方式。</p><p>Use this Review to further and deepen your comprehension of your preparation, keeping in mind that understanding always comes in hindsight. This is a great truth in The Way of Knowledge.</p><p>使用这篇回顾进一步加深你对准备工作的理解，记住，理解总是在事后才会出现。这是内识之路中的伟大真理。</p><p>Practice 196: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 196： 一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

It is also more wonderful than you realize. You are as yet afraid of it because of its great power. You are unsure if it will dominate you or control you, unsure of where it will take you and what you will have to do and unsure of what the result of all this will be. Yet as you go away from Knowledge, you re-enter confusion and the world of imagination. As you come closer to Knowledge, you enter certainty, confirmation and a world of reality and purpose. How can you know Knowledge from a distance? How can you determine its meaning without receiving its gifts?</p><p>内识比你意识到的更强大。它也比你意识到的更美妙。由于它的伟大力量，你目前仍然害怕它。你不确定它是否会支配你或控制你，不确定它会带你去往何处以及你必须做些什么，也不确定这一切的结果会是什么。然而，当你远离内识时，你重新进入了混乱和想象的世界。当你靠近内识时，你就进入了确定性、确认以及一个充满现实和目标的世界。你怎么能从远处知道内识呢？你怎么能在没有接受其馈赠的情况下确定它的意义呢？</p><p>Come close to Knowledge today. Allow it to silently abide within you, as you are learning to silently abide with it. Nothing could be more central to your natural experience than the experience of Knowledge. Be glad that it is greater than you realize, for your evaluation has been small. Be glad that you cannot understand it yet, for your understanding would only limit it and its usefulness to you. Allow the great to be with you so that your greatness may be demonstrated and experienced today.</p><p>今天靠近内识。让它静静地存在于你的内心深处，因为你正在学习与它默默相处。在你的自然经验中，没有什么比内识的体验更重要。庆幸它比你意识到的更伟大，因为你对它的评价还很渺小。庆幸你还无法理解它，因为你的理解只会限制它，限制它对你的作用。让伟大的内识与你同在，这样你的伟大今天也可以得到展现和体验。</p><p>Take this idea with you and practice it upon the hour. Keep it in mind throughout the day. In your two longer practice periods, allow yourself to experience the depth of Knowledge. Feel the power of Knowledge. Strengthen your resolve to do so. Dedicate your self-discipline, for here self-discipline is wisely employed. Knowledge is greater than you realize. Therefore, you must learn to receive its greatness.</p><p>今天带着这个想法，并在每个小时的练习中实践它。整天将其铭记于心。在你两个较长的练习时段中，允许自己体验内识的深度。感受内识的力量。增强你的决心。运用你的自律，因为在这里，自律得到了明智的运用。内识比你意识到的更伟大。因此，你必须学会接受它的伟大。</p><p>Practice 195: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 195 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

This necessity of action will give value and meaning to your activities and will affirm your worth in all of your engagements this day. Go where you are needed, where you need to go. Discern the actual motivation for this and distinguish it from any sense of guilt or obligation to others. Do not place artificial demands upon yourself. Do not allow others to place artificial demands upon you beyond your simple duties in this day. Go where you are truly needed. </p><p>让自己去需要你的地方，去你需要去的地方。这种行动的必要性将赋予你的活动价值和意义，并肯定你在今天所有活动中的价值。去需要你的地方，去你需要去的地方。找出这样做的真正动机，并将其与任何负罪感或对他人的义务区分开来。不要对自己提出人为的要求。不要让他人在你今天的简单职责之外对你提出人为的要求。去真正需要你的地方。</p><p>Remind yourself of this upon the hour, for its meaning must be penetrated to be experienced. If you are accustomed to guilt and obligation, today’s idea will seem to compound your difficulty. Yet today’s idea is really an affirmation of Knowledge within you, providing an opportunity for Knowledge to guide you and to demonstrate its value to you. It has nothing to do with dependence, for you must be independent of false things to follow that which is true. This is the value of all independence. </p><p>每时每刻都要提醒自己这一点，因为其意义必须深入体验。如果你习惯于内疚和义务，今天的想法似乎会加重你的困难。然而，今天的想法实际上是对你内识的肯定，为内识提供了一个引导你并向你展示其价值的机会。它与依赖无关，因为你必须独立于虚假的事物，才能追随真实的事物。这就是所有独立的价值所在。</p><p>In your longer practice periods, go deeply into Knowledge. And when you are in the world, keep this idea alive. Allow yourself to feel a deeper presence within you as you are out in the world of mundane things, as you are out in the world of small considerations. Greatness is here to serve the small. Remember.</p><p>在你较长的练习时间里，深入内识。当你在这个世界上的时候，要让这个想法保持活力。允许你自己感受到一种更深层次的存在，在你的内心深处，就像你在世俗的世界中一样，因为你在外面的世界要考虑的事情很少。伟大就在这里，为渺小服务。记住这一点。</p><p>Practice 194: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 194： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Knowledge will indicate if what they are saying is of  value or not. It will do this without any form of condemnation, without any comparison and without any evaluation on your part whatsoever. Knowledge is attracted to Knowledge, and it is not attracted to that which is not Knowledge. Therefore, you may find your rightful way without contributing judgment or hatred upon the world. This is your Inner Guidance system serving you. It will lead you where you need to be and will lead you to contribute where your contributions can be of the greatest value. If you listen to others without judgment, you will hear both Knowledge and the call for Knowledge. You will see where Knowledge exists and where it has been denied. This is natural. You do not need to judge people to make this determination. It is simply known.</p><p>今天，请不带评判地倾听他人。内识会指出他们所说的是否有价值。它不会对你进行任何形式的谴责，也不会对你进行任何比较和评价。内识会被内识所吸引，它不会被不是内识的关系所吸引。因此，你可以找到自己正确的道路，而无需对世界进行评判或仇恨。这是你的内在引导系统在为你服务。它将引领你到你需要去的地方，引领你到你能做出最大贡献的地方。如果你不带评判地倾听他人，你就会听到内识和对内识的呼唤。你会看到内识在哪里存在，又在哪里被剥夺。这很自然。你不需要评判他人来做出这个判断。它只是被简单地知道。</p><p>Listen to others so that you may experience yourself listening, for it is not your task to judge the world or to determine where and how your gifts should be given. It is your task to experience yourself in life and to allow Knowledge to arise, for Knowledge will give itself when and where it is appropriate. This allows you to have peace, for you are not trying to control the world.</p><p>倾听他人的声音，这样你才能体验到自己在倾听，因为你的任务不是评判世界，也不是决定在哪里以及如何给予你的礼物。你的任务是在生命中体验自己，让内识出现，因为内识会在适当的时候和适当的地方给予它自己。这让你拥有平静，因为你并不试图控制世界。</p><p>Allow your practices to be deep. Practice upon the hour as before. Listen to others today so that you may experience yourself in relationship with them, so that their true message to you may be given and comprehended. This will affirm for you the presence of Knowledge and the need for Knowledge in the world all at once.</p><p>让你的练习深入。像以前一样，在每一小时进行练习。今天，倾听他人的声音，这样你就能在与他人的关系中体验自己，从而获得并理解他们传达给你的真实讯息。这将同时肯定内识的存在以及世界对内识的需求。</p><p>Practice 193: Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 193： 每小时练习</p>]]></content>

Doing small things does not mean in any way that you are small. If you do not identify with your behavior and activities, you can allow your greatness to exist as you undertake them. Someone who is great can do small things without complaint. Someone who is with Knowledge can undertake mundane activities without any sense of disgrace. Activities are only activities. They do not constitute your true nature or being. Your true nature or being is the source of your life, which will express itself through your small activities as you learn to receive it and to see it in proper perspective.</p><p>今天不要忽视你需要做的小事。做小事并不意味着你是微不足道的。如果你不认同自己的行为和活动，你就能让自己的伟大在开展这些活动时得以体现。一个伟大的人可以毫无怨言地做小事。一个与内识同在的人可以毫无羞耻感地从事平凡的活动。活动只是活动，它们并不构成你的真实自然或存在。你的真实自然或存在是你生命的本源，当你学会接受它并以正确的视角看待它时，它就会通过你微小的活动表现出来。</p><p>Do not neglect small things. Care for small things so that your life in the world may be stable and may progress properly. Today, in your deeper practices, again enter the greatness and the depth of Knowledge. Because you have attended to small things, you can now spend this time of devotion and giving. In this way, your outer life is managed properly, and your inner life is attended to as well, for you are an intermediary between the life of greatness and life in the world. Thus, you attend to the small and you receive the great. This is your true function, for you are here to give Knowledge to the world. </p><p>不要忽视小事。关心小事，才能使你在这个世界上的生活稳定并正常发展。今天，在你的深入实践中，再次进入内识的伟大和深度。因为你已经照顾好了小事，所以你现在可以利用这段时间来奉献和给予。通过这种方式，你的外在生活得到了妥善管理，你的内在生活也得到了关注，因为你是伟大生命和世俗生活之间的中介。因此，你既关照小事，又接纳伟大。这就是你的真实职责，因为你来到这里是为了将内识带给这个世界。</p><p>As before, repeat your practice upon the hour. Take it with you. Do not forget.</p><p>像以前一样，每小时重复一次练习。随身带着它。不要忘记。</p><p>Practice 192: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习192：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

It eclipses your humanity but gives your humanity true  meaning. Greater Life wishes to express itself in your world, in your era and in the circumstances that actually exist now. Thus, the great expresses itself through the small, and the small experiences itself as the great. This is the way of all life. Your humanity is without meaning unless it serves a greater context and is a part of a Greater Reality. Without this, it is more a form of bondage—a restraint, a confinement and an imposition upon your nature rather than an affirmation of your nature. </p><p>你的内识诞生于宇宙的生命。它超越了你的人性，但又赋予你的人性真实的意义。更伟大的生命希望在你们的世界、你们的时代和现在实际存在的环境中表达自己。因此，伟大通过渺小来表达自己，而渺小通过伟大来体验自己。这是所有生命的法则。你的人性没有意义，除非它服务于一个更大的背景并成为一个更大现实的一部分。没有这一点，它更像是一种束缚——一种限制、一种禁锢和一种强加于你自然的枷锁，而非对你自然的肯定。</p><p>Your Knowledge is greater than your humanity. Thus, your humanity can have meaning, for it has something to serve. Without service, your humanity is merely a restraint, that which confines you and imprisons you. But your humanity is meant to serve a Greater Reality which you carry within you today. This Reality is in you, but you do not own it. You cannot use it for your own personal fulfillment. You can only receive it and allow it to express itself. It will express itself through your humanity, and it will give you a greater experience of yourself.</p><p>你的内识超越你的人性。因此，你的人性才能拥有意义，因为它有服务的对象。如果没有服务，你的人性只是一种束缚，将你限制和囚禁的枷锁。但是，你的人性是为了服务于一个更伟大的现实，而这个现实今天就在你的内心深处。这个现实就在你的内心，但你并不拥有它。你无法使用它来实现你的个人满足。你只能接受它，并允许它表达自己。它将通过你的人性来表达自己，它将给你带来更伟大的自我体验。</p><p>In your longer practice periods today, allow yourself to enter stillness once again, and upon the hour repeat this idea so that you may consider its true meaning. Do not accept mere assumptions or premature conclusions, for today’s idea will require your deep involvement. Life has depth. You must penetrate it. You must enter into it. You must receive it and inquire within it. Then you will become re-engaged in your natural relationship with life.</p><p>在今天较长的练习时间中，让自己再次进入静心状态，每小时重复这个想法，以便你能够思考它的真实意义。不要接受单纯的假设或过早的结论，因为今天的想法将需要你的深度参与。生命有其深度。你必须渗透它。你必须进入它。你必须接纳它，并在其中探寻。然后，你将重新投入与你自然生命关系的互动。</p><p>Practice 191: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 191 ：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

It is a turning point where your world gains contact with the worlds in its vicinity. This is the natural evolution of humanity, as it is the natural evolution of all intelligent life in all worlds. Your world is seeking a Greater Community. This will require that your world’s own internal community become unified. This is also a part of the evolution of all intelligent life in all worlds. You have come here to serve this. There are many levels of service and many things that need to be contributed—on a personal, on a community and on a world level. You are part of this great movement of life, for you are not here for your own purposes alone. You are here to serve the world, and thus be served in return.</p><p>你在一个伟大的转折点进入了这个世界，而在你有生之年，你只能看到这转折点的一部分。这是一个转折点，你们的世界开始与邻近的世界接触。这是人类的自然进化，正如所有世界中所有智能生命的自然进化一样。你们的世界正在寻求一个大社区。这要求你们的世界内部的社会必须团结一致。这也是所有智能生命进化的一部分。你来到这里是为了服务这个目标。在个人、社区和世界的层面上，都有许多不同层级的服务需要贡献。你是这个生命伟大运动的一部分，因为你来到这里并不只是为了你自己。你在这里是为了服务这个世界，从而得到服务的回报。</p><p>Today in your two longer practice periods, investigate the idea for the day. Give it serious thought, observing those ideas that are in harmony with it and those ideas that disagree with it. Examine your feelings both for and against this idea. Examine your preferences, your prejudices, your beliefs, your hopes, your fears and so forth. This constitutes the first half of each practice period. In the second half, enter stillness and silence, using the word RAHN if you find it to be helpful. Remember that both of these mental activities are necessary and complementary, as you shall learn in the future. Upon the hour repeat the idea for today. Allow it to provide that which you need to see the world in a new way.</p><p>今天，在两个较长的练习时间里，研究一下今天的想法。认真思考，观察与之相一致的想法和不一致的想法。审视你对这个想法的支持和反对的感觉。审视自己的偏好、偏见、信仰、希望和恐惧等等。这就是每次练习的前半部分。后半部分，进入静止和沉默状态，如果你觉得RAHN这个词对你有帮助，就使用它。记住，这两种心理活动都是必要的，也是相辅相成的，这一点你以后会学到。每小时重复一次今天的想法。让它为你提供以新的方式看待世界所需要的技能。</p><p>Practice 190: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It exists in many worlds. Its influence is everywhere.  That is why it is so meaningless to consider yourself to be alone when you are part of something so great that serves the greatest of all purposes. You must relinquish your selfcondemnation and your sense of littleness to know this, for you have identified with your behavior in the world, which is little. You have identified with your personal mind and your physical body, which are little. Yet now you are beginning to realize your relationship with life itself through Knowledge, which is great. This is done without punishing the personal mind or the physical body, for they become useful and enjoyable as they learn to serve a greater purpose. Then the body has health and the personal mind is utilized, rendering them meaning which they now lack.</p><p>你的精神家庭比你想象的更为广阔。它存在于许多世界，它的影响力无处不在。正因如此，当你属于一个如此伟大的整体并为最伟大的目的服务时，认为自己是孤立的显得毫无意义。要想知道这一点，你必须放弃对自己的谴责和自卑感，因为你已经与自己在世界中的行为相认同，而这些行为是渺小的。你也与个人的心灵和物质身体相认同，而它们也是渺小的。然而，现在你开始通过内识意识到自己与生命本身的关系，这种关系是伟大的。这并不是要惩罚个人的心灵或物质身体，因为它们在学会服务于更伟大的目的时会变得有用且令人愉悦。届时，身体会保持健康，个人的心灵会被善用，从而赋予它们现在所缺乏的意义。</p><p>Your physical need is for health, but your health is to serve a greater purpose. You need right utilization for your personal mind, which will give it meaning and value, for it only seeks to be included in that which is meaningful. What enables your personal mind and your physical body to find their rightful place in your life is Knowledge, which provides purpose, meaning and direction for you. </p><p>你在身体上的需求是健康，但你的健康是为了服务一个更伟大的目的。你需要正确地善用你的个人心灵，这将赋予它意义和价值，因为它只渴望被包含在有意义的事情中。使你的个人心灵和物质身体在你的生命中找到正确位置的，是内识，它为你提供了目的、意义和方向。</p><p>This is true in all worlds. This is true throughout the physical universe of which you are a citizen. Expand your view of yourself so that you may learn to be objective about your world. Do not merely cast human values, assumptions and goals upon your world, for this blinds you to the world’s purpose and evolution and makes it far more difficult for you to appreciate that you are a citizen of a greater life. </p><p>在所有的世界中都是如此。在你作为其公民的物质宇宙中也是如此。扩展你对自己的看法，这样你才能客观地看待你的世界。不要仅仅将人类的价值观、假设和目标投射到你的世界上，因为这会使你对世界的目的和进化视而不见，并使你更难体会到你是一个更伟大生命的公民。</p><p>Today, in your two longer practices, engage your mind in active investigation of this idea. Spend the first fifteen minutes engaged in this investigation in both of your two longer practice periods. Try to seriously investigate the meaning of today’s idea. Then when your investigation is complete, allow your mind to re-enter stillness. Realize the contrast between active mental engagement and mental stillness. Understand that both are important and complement one another. Upon the hour repeat the idea and consider it as you view the world around you.</p><p>今天，在你两次较长时间的练习中，让你的心灵积极地探索这个想法。在两次较长的练习期间的前十五分钟，专注于这一探索。认真地探讨今天这个想法的意义。然后，当你的探索完成时，让你的心灵再次进入静止状态。意识到积极的心理参与和心灵静心之间的对比。理解两者都很重要，并且相辅相成。每小时重复一次今天的想法，并在你观察周围世界时思考它。</p><p>Practice 189: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 189 ：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

No, it is not. Does this idea betray your need for humility? No, it does not. You are here for a greater purpose than you have imagined, for your imagination does not contain the meaning of your purpose in life. In life there is only purpose and all the things that are substitutes for this purpose, which are born of fearful imagination. You are here to live a greater life than you have yet realized, and this greatness is what you carry within you. It may be expressed in the simplest of lifestyles and in the simplest of activities. Activities are great because of the essence that they convey, not because of the stimulation that they may arouse in other people.</p><p>这是否是一种夸大的想法？不，它不是。这个想法是否暴露了你需要谦逊？不，它没有。你来到这里的目的比你想象的更伟大，因为你的想象未能涵盖你生命目的的真正意义。在生命中，只有目的，以及那些替代目的的事物，而这些事物是出于恐惧的想象。你来到这里是为了过一种比你目前意识到的更伟大的生命，而这种伟大存在于你的内心深处。它可能在最简单的生活方式和最简单的活动中表达出来。活动之所以伟大，是因为它们所传达的实质，而不是因为它们可能在其他人中引发的刺激。</p><p>Understand this distinction very carefully, and you will begin to learn to discern greatness from smallness and to learn how smallness can serve greatness. This will integrate every aspect of yourself, for part of you is great and part of you is small. Your personal mind and your physical body are small and are meant to serve the greatness of Knowledge. This integrates you. This is what integrates life as well. There is no inequality here, for everything is working together to serve a greater purpose, which you have come to serve.</p><p>要非常仔细地理解这个区分，你将开始学会分辨伟大与渺小，并学会如何让渺小为伟大服务。这将整合你自己的一切，因为你的一部分是伟大的，而另一部分是渺小的。你的个人心灵和身体是渺小的，它们是为了服务于内识的伟大而存在的。这使你得以整合。这也是整合生命的方式。这里没有不平等，因为一切都在共同服务于一个更伟大的目的，而你来到这里正是为了服务这个目的。</p><p>In your longer practice periods today, engage your mind actively in attempting to understand these things. Your understanding will be born of your investigation, not merely of ideas that you find self-comforting or personally agreeable. Use your mind to investigate. With eyes closed, think on these things. Concentrate very carefully, and when your concentration comes to an end, release all ideas and enter into stillness and silence. Thus, the mind is purposefully engaged, and then it is brought into stillness. These are the two functions of the mind, which you will be practicing today. </p><p>今天在你较长的练习时间里，积极运用你的心灵，尝试去理解这些事情。你的理解将来源于你的探索，而不仅仅是你找到的那些让你感到安慰或个人认同的想法。运用你的心灵进行探索。闭上眼睛，思考这些问题。非常仔细地集中注意力，当你的专注结束时，放下所有的想法，进入静止与沉默。因此，心灵被有目的地投入使用，然后进入静心。这是心灵的两种功能，你今天将会练习这两种功能。</p><p>Remind yourself of your practice upon the hour and utilize this day for your development, which is your gift to the world.</p><p>每小时提醒自己的练习，并利用这一天来发展你自己，而这正是你对世界的馈赠。</p><p>Practice 188: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You are a citizen of the Greater Community  of worlds. This is the physical universe that you recognize through your senses. It is far greater than you can now comprehend. The extent of its relationships are far greater than you can even imagine, for reality is always greater than imagination. </p><p>你不仅仅是这个世界上的一个人类。你是世界大社区的公民。这是你通过感官所识别的物质宇宙。它远比你现在所能理解的要广阔得多。它关系的深度超出了你所能想象的范围，因为现实总是超越想象。</p><p>You are a citizen of a greater physical universe. This acknowledges not only your Lineage and your Heritage but also your purpose in life at this time, for the world of humanity is growing into the life of the Greater Community of worlds. This is known to you, though your beliefs may not yet account for it.</p><p>你是一个更大物质宇宙的公民。这不仅承认了你的世系和传承，也承认了你此时在生命中的目的，因为人类世界正在融入世界大社区的生命之中。虽然你们的信仰可能还无法解释这一点，但你是知道的。</p><p>Today, upon the hour, affirm your citizenship in the Greater Community of worlds, for this affirms a greater life that you are now beginning to discover. In your two meditation practices, once again enter stillness and quietude. This growing experience of stillness will enable you to understand all things, for your mind was created to assimilate Knowledge, and this is how understanding comes about. The accumulation of ideas and the accumulation of theories do not constitute either Knowledge or understanding, for understanding is born of true affinity and experience. In this, it has no parallel in the world and can thus serve the world that you perceive.</p><p>今天，在每个小时，确认你是世界大社区的公民，因为这肯定了你现在开始发现的更大生命。在你的两次冥想练习中，再次进入静止与安静。这种日益增长的静心体验将使你能够理解一切，因为你的心灵是为了吸收内识而创造的，而理解就是通过这种方式产生的。想法的积累和理论的积累并不构成内识或理解，因为理解源于真实的亲和力和体验。在这一点上，它在世界上没有任何平行之物，因此能够服务于你所感知的世界。</p><p>Practice 187: Two 30-minute practice periods.

This will arise in your mind naturally, though it is beyond  words and beyond description. In essence, it is a pure experience of life and inclusion. What is remembered in this experience are those relationships that you have cultivated thus far in your evolution up until this time. Only the reclamation of relationships can be carried forward beyond your life in this world. The individuals that you have reclaimed unto yourself as your Spiritual Family now exist as your Spiritual Family. They form the growing body of Knowledge and inclusion in life which you are now capable of experiencing.</p><p>你诞生于古老的传承。这将在你的心灵中自然升起，尽管它超越话语和描述。从本质上讲，这是一种对生命和包容的纯粹体验。在这种体验中，所记住的是你在进化过程中迄今为止所培养的那些关系。只有关系的恢复可以超越你在这个世界的生命，并将这个生命带入未来。那些被你视为精神家园的个体，现在正作为你的精神家园而存在。他们构成了你现在能够体验的内识和生命包容的不断增长的主体。</p><p>You are here to serve your Spiritual Family, your small learning group that have been working together through many ages and circumstances in order to cultivate and advance their members so that your group may join with other groups, and so forth. Like streams joining together into greater and greater bodies of moving water, you follow your inevitable course to the source of your life. This is the natural way, the genuine way, the way that exists beyond all speculation and philosophy, beyond all the fears and ambitions of humanity. This is the way of things—forever mysterious, beyond your comprehension and yet fully available to serve you in the immediate circumstances of your life. Such is the greatness of the mystery of your life, and such is its application in even the smallest detail of your life. Thus, your life here is complete. </p><p>你在此服务于你的精神家庭，你的小型学习小组，这些小组经过多个时代和不同的境遇共同努力，培养和提升他们的成员，以便你们的小组能够与其他小组联合，就像溪流汇聚成越来越大的流动水体，顺应生命的源头而流动。这是自然的道路，真正的道路，超越所有猜测和哲学，超越人类所有的恐惧和野心的道路。这是事物的方式——永远神秘，超越你的理解，但在你生命的每一个细节中都完全可以为你服务。这就是你生命的伟大神秘，也是它在你生命中每一个最小细节中的应用。因此，你的生命在这里是完整的。</p><p>You are born of a great Heritage. Thus, greatness is with you because of your relationships. Receive this Heritage in stillness in your two deep meditation practices today and acknowledge it upon the hour. Allow this day to demonstrate both the reality and the denial of this great truth, for as you see the world in its denial attempting to act out the substitutes for Knowledge, you will learn to value Knowledge and to realize that Knowledge is here already.</p><p>你诞生于伟大的传承。因此，伟大与你同在，因为你的关系。今天，在你两次深度冥想的静心中接纳这份传承，并在每个整点时刻确认它。让今天展示这个伟大真理的现实和否认，当你看到世界在否认内识的过程中试图表现出替代品时，你将学会珍视内识，并意识到内识已经在这里准备就绪。</p><p>Practice 186: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Regardless of your current stage of personal development, the reality of your purpose in life remains true. Therefore, from time to time We repeat certain lessons that are essential for your well-being and development. We give them different wording from time to time so that you may have a greater and greater experience of them. In this way, they may find their way into your heart so that your heart may find its way into your consciousness.</p><p>我们再次确认这个伟大的真理，当你拥有内识时，你会知道它是真实的。无论你个人发展的阶段如何，你生命中的目的始终存在。因此，我们会不时重复某些对你的福祉和发展至关重要的课程。我们会以不同的措辞表达它们，这样你就可以越来越深刻地体验到它们。这样，它们可以找到通往你内心的道路，从而你的内心可以进入你的意识。</p><p>You are here to serve. You are here to give. You are here because you are rich with Knowledge. Regardless of your circumstance in life, your own sense of poverty will be banished forever as Knowledge arises within you, for there can be no sense of deprivation when Knowledge is being experienced and expressed. This is the promise of this program of preparation. This is the promise of your life. This is your destiny and your mission here. From this, your specific calling in the world will be given to you. It will be quite specific to your activities and behavior. Before this can happen, your mind must be cultivated, and your life must be rearranged and brought into genuine balance so that it may reflect your Knowledge and not your fears and wishes only. A greater life must come from a Greater Source within you. A greater life is made possible for you now.</p><p>你来到这里是为了服务。你在这里是为了给予。你在这里是因为你拥有内识的财富。不管你现在的生命状况如何，当内心深处的内识在你内心升起时，你对贫乏的感受将永远消失，因为在体验和表达内识时，不会有任何匮乏感。这就是这项准备计划的承诺，也是你生命的承诺。这是你的天命和你在这里的使命。从这一点出发，你在世界上的具体召唤将会向你展现。它将具体体现在你的行为和活动中。但在这发生之前，你的心灵必须得到培养，你的生命必须重新调整并达到真正的平衡，使其反映你的内识，而不仅仅是你的恐惧和愿望。一个更伟大的生命必须来自你内心深处更伟大的本源。现在，一个更伟大的生命对你而言是可能的。</p><p>You are here to serve, but to serve you must receive. In your longer practice periods today, practice receptivity. Go deeper in your practice of stillness. Cultivate this practice. You are now learning the specific skills that will help you to do this. When your will is being experienced, the methods will follow naturally. We give only so much methodology as is necessary to aim your mind in the proper direction. From here you can refine your practice to meet your needs without betraying the instructions that are given in this course. </p><p>你来到这里是为了服务，但要服务，你必须先收到。在今天的较长练习时间里，练习接收能力。加深你在静心中的练习。培养这种练习。你现在正在学习帮助你做到这一点的具体技能。当你的意志得到体验时，方法会自然地随之而来。我们只提供足够的技巧来引导你的心灵朝向正确的方向。从这里开始，你可以根据自己的需求精细化练习，而不背离本课程中给予的指导。</p><p>Therefore, follow the directions that are given and make minor adjustments as necessary. When you learn to work with your nature, you will learn to utilize it on your own behalf. Practice upon the hour so that your practice may go with you everywhere and so that everything that happens to you today may be a part of your practice.</p><p>因此，遵循所给予的指示，并根据需要进行小的调整。当你学会与自己的自然合作时，你将学会使用它为你自己服务。每小时进行练习，这样你的练习可以伴随你走到任何地方，并且今天发生的每一件事都可以成为你练习的一部分。</p><p>Practice 185: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Though your questions may have arisen out of immediate circumstances, you are asking for far more than immediate resolution to immediate things. Immediate resolution will be given, but from a Greater Source. It is this Greater Source that you are seeking, for you are seeking to realize your nature here, and you are seeking to find the preparation that will enable you to contribute your gifts so that your work in the world may be complete. Therefore, understand that you are here to serve. You are here to give. And in so doing, you will find your fulfillment. This will produce happiness for you.</p><p>你真正寻求的远远超过了你以前所想象的。虽然你的问题可能源于眼前的境况，但你所要求的远不止是对当下问题的解决。眼前的问题会得到解决，但解决将来自一个更伟大的源头。而你正在寻找的，正是这个更伟大的源头，因为你正在寻求认识你在此的自然，你正在寻找能够帮助你贡献自己的礼物的准备，这样你的世间工作才能圆满完成。因此，要理解你在这里是为了服务。你在这里是为了给予。而在这么做的过程中，你将找到自己的满足。这将为你带来幸福。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods today, once again enter into stillness and silence, keeping in mind that stillness cultivates the mind to receive. In stillness you find that things are known already that you have neglected thus far. From these practice periods your mind will become more refined and have greater depth, greater concentration and a greater focus in all aspects of your life. </p><p>在今天的两次较长的练习时间中，再次进入静心与沉默，记住静心培养心灵去接收。在静心中，你会发现一些你早已知道却至今忽视的关系。通过这些练习，你的心灵将变得更加精炼，并在生命的各个方面拥有更大的深度、更强的专注力和更集中的焦点。</p><p>What you are seeking today is something greater than you have considered before.

Seek experience today so that it may lead you to greater and greater experience. It is better for you to ask questions of Knowledge and then receive the experience that Knowledge can give you. You are accustomed to receiving so little in response to your inquiries. An answer is so very little. A true answer must be an invitation to participate in a greater preparation, in a preparation you have not prepared for yourself but which has been prepared for you. Therefore, seek not for little things that give you momentary relief or comfort. Seek for that which is the foundation of your life, which can provide life to you as never before.</p><p>今天去寻求体验，因为体验会回答所有问题，并使提问变得不再必要。今天去寻求体验，因为它会引领你走向越来越多的体验。最好是向内识提问，然后接受内识可以带给你的体验。你习惯于从询问中得到很少的回应。一个答案是如此微不足道。一个真实的答案必须是一种邀请，邀请你参与到一个更大的准备之中，一种你尚未为自己做好的准备，但内识已经为你做好准备。因此，不要只寻求那些能给你短暂解脱或安慰的小事。要寻求的是你生命的根基，它可以以一种前所未有的方式给予你生命。</p><p>Today, in your two deeper practices, become receptive to this experience. You may use the word RAHN if you find it helpful, but enter deeply into the experience of Knowledge. Do not seek for answers. Ideas will come to you in their own time and in their own way. You can be assured of that. As your mind is prepared, it will become truly receptive and truly capable of carrying out what it receives. This is the acknowledgment that you need. It must be born of great experience.</p><p>今天，在你两次深入的练习中，要对这种体验保持接纳的态度。如果你觉得有帮助，可以使用RAHN这个词，但要深深进入内识的体验。不要去寻求答案。想法会在自己的时间、以自己的方式出现在你面前。这一点你可以放心。当你的心灵做好准备，它将真正具备接受和执行它所接收内识的能力。这就是你需要的确认，它必须源于伟大的体验。</p><p>Upon the hour remind yourself of your practice, and realize it is genuine experience that you are seeking and not answers alone. Your mind is full of answers, and they have not answered your questioning thus far.</p><p>每小时提醒自己进行练习，并意识到你真正寻求的是体验，而不仅仅是答案。你的心灵中充满了答案，但它们至今没有解答你的疑问。</p><p>Practice 183: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Think of your outer life and recognize how much needs to be accomplished there, both on your own behalf and for the well-being of others.

Observe the development that has occurred within you these past few months—the growing sense of presence, the growing sense of inner certainty, the growing sense of inner power. Allow for the fact that your outer life has begun to open. Certain things that were fixed before have now been loosened so that they may be rearranged on your behalf. Allow your outer life to be rearranged, now that you are not seeking to dominate it for your personal protection. As a greater certainty arises within you, outer circumstances must be rearranged on your own behalf. Thus, you become a source of change and not the recipient of it only. </p><p>回顾过去的一周，思考你到目前为止的准备过程。观察过去几个月内你自身的发展——日益增强的存在感、日益增强的内在确定性、日益增强的内在力量。承认你的外在生活已经开始打开。一些之前固定的事物现在已经松动，以便为你重新安排。现在，你不再为了个人的安全而试图掌控它时，允许你的外在生活被重新安排。随着你内在的确定性增强，外部环境也必须为你重新调整。因此，你成为了改变的源头，而不仅仅是被动接受改变的人。</p><p>Recognize how far you have come, but keep in mind that you are a beginning student of Knowledge. Allow this to be your starting point so that you may assume little and receive a great deal. From this great point of reference, you will be able to see beyond the prejudice and the condemnation of humanity. You will be able to see beyond a personal viewpoint and have a vision of the world that the world is desperate to receive.</p><p>认识到你已经走了多远，但请记住，你是内识的初学者。让这一点成为你的起点，以便你假设的很少，获得的却很多。从这个伟大的参照点出发，你将能够超越人类的偏见和谴责。你将能够超越个人视角，拥有世界迫切需要的视野。</p><p>Practice 182: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 182 ：一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

In your two deeper practices today, enter into the presence of Knowledge and receive its love. Affirm your worthiness and your receptivity. Relinquish your presumptions about yourself and the world, and allow yourself to have an experience that will demonstrate the truth beyond any assumption. This is your practice today. This is your gift to yourself, to your world and to your Creator so that you may receive the gift of love.</p><p>每小时重复这一声明，感受它的全部影响，无论你处于何种情境中。让每个情境都支持你的练习，你会发现你的练习会对你的外在生活产生越来越强的影响。在今天两次深入的练习中，进入内识的存在，接收它的爱。确认你值得并能够接受。放下你对自己和世界的假设，允许自己体验一种超越任何假设的真理。这就是你今天的练习。这是你给予自己、给予你的世界以及给予造物主的礼物，这样你就能收到这份爱的礼物。</p><p>Practice 181: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 181 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百八十阶：我的抱怨，是因为我缺乏内识</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/22/180/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-180-I-complain-because-I-am-lacking-Knowledge"><a href="#Step-180-I-complain-because-I-am-lacking-Knowledge" class="headerlink" title="Step 180 I complain because I am lacking Knowledge."></a>Step 180 I complain because I am lacking Knowledge.</h2><p>When you complain about life, you are asking for Knowledge. Knowledge has its own statement about life, but it is very different from the lament which you hear within yourself and around you. Therefore, as you approach Knowledge today, recognize the nature of complaint—how it emphasizes your weakness and the world’s domination over you and how much it is in contrast to what you are learning now. You are learning now to discover your greatness and your domination over the world. You are in relationship with the world. Let this relationship become healthy and meaningful. Let the world’s contribution be given to you. Let your contribution be given to the world. </p><p>当你抱怨生命时，你其实是在向内识寻求帮助。内识对生命有其独特的见解，但它与你内心和周围听到的哀叹截然不同。因此，当你今天走向内识时，要认识到抱怨的本质——它如何强调你的弱点以及世界对你的控制，而这与现在你所学习的内容有多么大的对比。你正在学习如何发现自己的伟大和对世界的掌控。你与世界有着关系，让这种关系变得健康且有意义。让世界的馈赠传递给你，也让你的馈赠回馈给世界。</p><p>Therefore, thank the world once again today for what it has given to you. In your deeper meditation practices today, enter stillness and silence. Use the word RAHN to help you enter this deeply. Use the word RAHN to orient your mind and thinking so that your mind may become unified with the sound of this one ancient word. </p><p>因此，今天再次感谢世界给予你的所有。在今天更深的冥想练习中，进入静心与沉默。使用RAHN这个词帮助你深深地进入这种状态。使用RAHN来引导你的心灵和思维，使你的心灵与这个古老词汇的声音融为一体。</p><p>This is a day of important contribution. Do not complain about this day. Recognize that everything that happens is an opportunity for you to apply your practice and to develop the true faculties of your mind. Your complaint would only be a denial of the world’s contribution to you. Therefore, do not deny this. Do not complain about the world today so that you may receive its gifts.</p><p>今天是一个具有重要贡献的一天。不要对这一天抱怨。要认识到，所发生的一切都为你提供了运用你的实践和发展你心灵真实能力的机会。你的抱怨只会否定世界对你的贡献。因此，不要否认这一点。不要抱怨今天的世界，这样你才能收到它的礼物。</p><p>Practice 180: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 180 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百七十九阶：今天，我要感谢这个世界教会了我什么是真实</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/22/179/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-179-Today-I-will-thank-the-world-for-teaching-me-what-is-true"><a href="#Step-179-Today-I-will-thank-the-world-for-teaching-me-what-is-true" class="headerlink" title="Step 179 Today I will thank the world for teaching me what is true."></a>Step 179 Today I will thank the world for teaching me what is true.</h2><p>The world in its grandeur and in its folly teaches you what to value and to recognize what is true. Contrast must be evident in learning for you to make these distinctions. To distinguish what is true from what is false and what is meaningful from what is meaningless, you must have contrast in learning. You must taste the meaningless to find out its true nature and content, and you must taste the meaningful to find out its true nature and content. The world continuously provides you the opportunity to do both. </p><p>世界在其宏伟和愚昧中教会你什么值得珍视，并让你认识到什么是真实的。学习中必须显现对比，这样你才能做出这些区分。要分辨真实与虚假、意义与无意义，你必须在学习中体验对比。你必须品尝无意义的关系，以发现它的本质和内容；你也必须品尝有意义的关系，以发现它的本质和内容。世界不断为你提供这两种体验的机会。</p><p>At this time your need is to taste the true, increasingly, and that is why We emphasize this in your daily practice now. You have already indulged yourself in the false so sufficiently that it has dominated your mind and attention. Now We feed you the true, but you must also learn to benefit from what the false has given you. Then you will need to investigate the false no more. The false has already presented itself to you. Now you are learning to recognize its presentation and to utilize what benefit it can offer you. The only benefit the false can offer you is to learn to recognize its lack of substance so that you may desire to know what is true and have greater capacity to receive it. </p><p>此刻，你需要越来越多地品尝真实，这就是为什么我们现在在你的日常练习中强调这一点。你已经充分沉迷于虚假，以至于它主宰了你的心灵和注意力。现在，我们给予你真实的体验，但你也必须学会从虚假中受益。这样，你就不再需要探究虚假。虚假已经向你展示了自己。现在你正在学习识别它的表现，并使用它能给你带来的任何益处。虚假能给你的唯一益处就是让你认识到它缺乏实质，从而使你渴望知道真实，并具有更大的能力去接纳真实。</p><p>Thus, thank the world today for supporting you, for its grandeur and for its folly, for its moments of inspiration and for its great display of illusion. The world you see so far is largely comprised of the fantasy of individuals, but there is a greater world for you to see, a world that is actually there, a world that will arouse in you Knowledge, appreciation and true self-application as well. For it is your purpose to serve the evolution of this world, as it is the world’s purpose to serve your evolution.</p><p>因此，今天感谢世界对你的支持，感谢它的宏伟和愚昧，感谢它激发灵感的时刻以及它所呈现的巨大幻象。你目前所看到的世界在很大程度上是个人幻想的集合，但还有一个更大的世界等着你去看，一个真实存在的世界，一个能唤起你内识的世界、欣赏和真实自我应用的世界。因为你的目的在于服务这个世界的进化，就如同这个世界的目的在于服务你的进化。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods today, investigate this idea actively with your mind. Apply your mind to understanding how the world has supported you. Think very carefully about this. This is not a superficial investigation. It is an investigation that you must conduct with necessity and with seriousness, for it will determine your experience in life, both in the present and in the future.</p><p>今天，在你两个较长的练习时间里，运用你的心灵积极探究这个理念。运用你的心灵去理解世界是如何支持你的。认真思考这个问题。这不是一个表面的探究。这是一个你必须带着必要性和严肃性进行的探究，因为它将决定你在生命中的经验，无论是现在还是未来。</p><p>Upon the hour, remember Our statement for today and keep it in mind when you view the world. Do not let this day be wasted upon you. This day is a day of recognition, a day of gratitude and a day of wisdom.</p><p>每小时提醒自己今天的陈述，并在观察世界时牢记在心。不要让这一天在你身上白费。这一天是一个认知的日子，一个感恩的日子，一个智慧的日子。</p><p>Practice 179: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习179：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

It is a special day of acknowledging the gifts that have been given to you. It is a day meant for gratitude.</p><p>这是一个特别的日子，用来承认你生命中真正关系的存在。也是一个用来感激你所得到礼物的特殊日子。这是一个充满感恩的日子。</p><p>Upon the hour, then, repeat this statement and take a moment to recall those who have given to you. Try to think very carefully of the individuals who have given benefit to you, both by demonstrating their wisdom and their error. Think of those who have illustrated the way to go and the way not to go. As you inquire further into this in your two longer practice periods today, try to think more carefully and allow any individual who comes to mind to be the subject of your investigation. This is an active practice time in your meditation periods.</p><p>然后，每小时重复这一句话，并花片刻时间回想那些给予过你帮助的人。仔细思考那些通过展示他们的智慧和错误而使你受益的人。想想那些为你指明前进道路以及不该走的道路的人。在今天两个较长的练习时间中，进一步探寻这一点，尽量更仔细地思考，让任何浮现在你心灵中的人都成为你调查的对象。这是你冥想时间中的一种积极的练习。</p><p>In your longer practice periods, repeat the statement at the beginning of practice and allow individuals to come to you. Learn to recognize their contribution to the reclamation of Knowledge. Learn to recognize their contribution to your physical and emotional well-being. Learn to recognize how they have served you. In this way, your entire concept of giving and receiving and of service in the world may be expanded and developed. This will give you a true vision of the world so that you may learn to be compassionate with yourself and with others. </p><p>在较长的练习时间中，在练习开始时重复这一句话，让人们浮现在你的心灵中。学会认识他们对内识回归的贡献。学会认识他们对你身心健康的贡献。学会认识他们如何服务于你。通过这种方式，你关于给予和接收以及在世界中服务的整个概念都可以被扩展和发展。这将给予你对世界的真实愿景，使你学会对自己和他人富有同情心。</p><p>This, then, is a day of affirmation and a day of gratitude. Allow your practices to be meaningful and effective so that you may receive their reward.</p><p>因此，这一天是确认与感恩的一天。让你的练习变得有意义且有效，这样你就能从中获得回报。</p><p>Practice 178: Two 30-minute practice periods.

There is a greater honesty that you must utilize on your own behalf. It is not enough merely to know how you feel. It is a greater requirement to feel what you know. This is a greater honesty and an honesty that is in harmony with life itself, an honesty that reflects the true advancement of all beings in the world. This is not merely expressing and demanding that your personal intent be carried out. It is demanding instead that the necessity of life within you may express itself in a way that is genuine to life itself. The form and the manner of this expression will be contained in the messages that you will need to deliver to others when the time comes for that to happen.</p><p>有一种更大的诚实等待你去发现。你必须运用这种更大的诚实来支持自己。仅仅知道自己的感受是不够的，更大的要求是感受你所知道的。这是一种更大的诚实，一种与生命本身和谐的诚实，一种反映世界上所有生命真实进步的诚实。这不仅仅是表达和要求你个人的意图被执行，而是要求你内心深处生命的必要性以一种真正符合生命本身的方式来表达。当时机成熟时，这种表达的形式和方式将包含在你需要传递给他人的讯息中。</p><p>Learn, then, to feel what you know. This is a greater honesty. It requires both openness and restraint. It requires selfinspection. It requires objectivity about your life. It requires stillness and peace as well as the ability to engage your mind actively in exploration. Thus, all that you have learned so far is contributed and utilized in today’s practice.</p><p>那么，学会去感受你所知道的吧。这是一种更大的诚实。它既需要开放又需要克制。它需要自我反省。它需要对你的生命保持客观。它需要静止与和平，也需要你能够积极地运用你的心灵进行探索。因此，迄今为止你所学到的一切都将被用于今天的练习。</p><p>Remind yourself upon the hour of today’s practice and seriously consider it in the moment in which you find yourself. In the longer practices today, again enter stillness and engage your mind in this meaningful activity. The mind must be brought into the proximity of its Ancient Home for it to find comfort and peace. This requires self-discipline at the outset, but once the engagement is made, the process happens in and of itself naturally.</p><p>提醒自己每小时进行一次今天的练习，并在当下认真思考。在今天更长的练习中，再次进入宁静，并让你的心灵参与到这个有意义的活动中。为了找到安慰与和平，心灵必须被带入其古老家园的邻近之地。这在一开始需要自律，但一旦投入其中，这个过程就会自然而然地发生。</p><p>Learn to become more honest today. Learn to discern a greater level of honesty, a genuine level of honesty that affirms your very nature and does not betray your highest purpose.</p><p>今天学会变得更加诚实。学会辨别更高水平的诚实，这种真正的诚实肯定了你的自然，并且不会背叛你的最高宗旨。</p><p>Practice 177: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Make small decisions about small things as it is necessary, but make no great decisions without Knowledge. You have a personal mind to make small, insignificant decisions. But greater decisions should be made with Knowledge. </p><p>在今天的每一个小时里，体验自己追随内识。在必要时对小事做出小决定，但在没有内识的情况下不做大决定。你有个人的心智，可以做出微不足道的小决定。但更大的决定应由内识做出。</p><p>Follow Knowledge today upon the hour. Allow its peace and its certainty to abide with you. Allow its overall direction to be discerned by you. Allow its potency to affect you. Allow it to give itself to you as you are now learning to give yourself to it.</p><p>在今天的时刻，跟随内识。让它的平静和确定与你同在。让它的整体方向为你所辨识。让它的力量影响你。让它把自己交给你，就像你现在学习把自己交给它一样。</p><p>In your two longer meditation practices today, using the word RAHN, enter deeply into Knowledge. Enter deeply into the presence of life. Enter deeply into this experience. Continue to direct your mind towards this accomplishment. Continue to set aside anything that affects you or holds you back. In this way, you train the mind and prepare it as well for that which is most natural to it to occur.</p><p>在今天两次较长时间的冥想练习中，使用RAHN这个词，深深地进入内识。深入生命的存在。深深进入这种体验。继续将你的心灵引向这个成就。继续抛开任何影响你或阻碍你的想法。这样，你就能训练自己的心灵，并为最自然的事情发生做好准备。</p><p>Follow Knowledge this day. If Knowledge indicates something and you are very certain about this, follow it and be observant. See what happens and try to learn to distinguish Knowledge from your impulses, your wishes, your fears and your avoidances. This must be learned through experience. In this way, Knowledge and everything that pretends to be Knowledge are drawn apart in contrast. This will provide for you greater certainty and greater self-confidence, which you will need in the times to come.</p><p>这一天，跟随内识。如果内识指出了什么，而你又非常确定，那就跟随它，并多加观察。看看会发生什么，试着学会将内识与你的冲动、愿望、恐惧和逃避区分开来。这必须通过经验来学习。这样，内识和一切假装是内识的东西就会在对比中被区分开来。这将为你提供更大的确定性和更强的自信心，而这正是你未来所需要的。</p><p>Practice 176: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It is not a biological accident. It is not a mere chance circumstance that you arrived  in this world. Your life is necessary. If you could but recall what you went through to come into this world and the preparation that was required—both within this world and beyond—for you to emerge here, then you would realize the importance of your being here and the importance of the Knowledge that you carry within you. Your life is necessary. There is no form of conceit here. It is simply a recognition of truth. In your evaluation of yourself, your life is either pathetic or grandiose. Yet the necessity of your life has nothing to do with your evaluations, though your evaluations can bring you closer to or take you farther from this one true recognition.</p><p>你的生命是必要的。这不是生理上的意外。你来到这个世界并非偶然。你的生命是必要的。如果你能回想一下你来到这个世界所经历的一切，回想一下你在这个世界内外为来到这里所做的准备，你就会意识到你来到这里的重要性，以及你所携带的内识的重要性。你的生命是必要的。这里没有任何形式的自负。这只是对真理的认识。在你对自己的评价中，你的生命要么可悲，要么伟大。然而，你生命的必要性与你的评价无关，尽管你的评价会让你更接近或远离这唯一真实的认知。</p><p>Your life is necessary. Understand this and it will banish your sense of self-judgment and condemnation. Understand this and it will bring humility into your self-grandiose ideas. Understand this and your plans may then in time be adjusted to Knowledge itself, for your life is necessary.</p><p>你的生命是必要的。理解了这一点，你就会摆脱自我评判和谴责。理解了这一点，你自我陶醉的想法就会变得谦逊。理解了这一点，你的计划就可能及时调整为内识本身，因为你的生命是必要的。</p><p>Repeat this statement upon the hour and consider it regardless of your emotions, your circumstances and whatever thoughts are prevailing in your mind, for Knowledge is greater than thoughts and is meant to govern thoughts. In your two meditation practices, allow the word RAHN to take you deep into practice. Feel the necessity of your own life—its value and its importance. This is something that you can experience directly. It does not require your evaluation. It does not require that you consider yourself to be greater than others. It is merely a profound experience of reality, for your life is necessary. It is necessary for you. It is necessary for your world. It is necessary for life itself.</p><p>每隔一小时就重复这句话，无论你的情绪、你的环境和你心中的任何想法如何，都要考虑它，因为内识大于感想，是用来主导感想的。在你的两次冥想练习中，让RAHN这个词带你深入实践。感受自己生命的必要性——它的价值和重要性。这是你可以直接体验到的。它不需要你的评价。它不需要你认为自己比别人伟大。这只是对现实的深刻体验，因为你的生命是必要的。它对你是必要的。它对你的世界是必要的。它对生命本身是必要的。</p><p>Practice 174: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 174： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

This at first seems oppressive to human beings, for they are accustomed to living in fantasy, where everything is preferential and nothing is really necessary.</p><p>做必要的事会让你的生命充满活力，因为世界上各种形式的生命都是在做必要的事。起初，这对人类来说似乎是一种压迫，因为他们习惯于生活在幻想中，在幻想中一切都是优先的，没有什么是真正必要的。</p><p>Yet it is when something is really necessary in life, even if it is a dire circumstance, that people are able to liberate themselves momentarily from their fantasies and feel purpose, meaning and direction. This, then, is a gift to humanity, but people usually give themselves this gift only under dire circumstances.</p><p>然而，正是在生命中某些事情真正变得必要时，哪怕是在危急的情况下，人们才能够暂时从幻想中解放出来，感受到目的、意义和方向。因此，这对人类而言是一份礼物，但人们通常只有在危急的情况下才会给自己这份礼物。</p><p>It is under happier circumstances that you must now learn to receive this and welcome necessity as a saving grace in your life, for you wish to be needed, you wish to be included, you wish to be vital and you wish to be an essential part of community. This is all necessary. It is not merely a preference on your part. It cannot be born of a casual choice but of a deep conviction, for your greater giving must be born of a deep conviction if it is to be great and complete. Otherwise, at the sight of the first adversity or disappointment, you will be cast away and will withdraw back into fantasy and illusion.</p><p>正是在这种更幸福的环境中，你现在必须学会接受这一点，并欢迎将必要性作为你生命中的一种拯救恩典，因为你希望被需要，你希望被包容，你希望有生命力，你希望成为社区的重要组成部分。这一切都是必要的。这不能仅仅是你的喜好。它不能源于随意的选择，而必须源于深刻的信念。因为你更伟大的给予必须源于一种深刻的信念，才能真正伟大而完整。否则，在遇到第一次逆境或失望时，你将会退缩，重新陷入幻想和错觉之中。</p><p>Welcome, then, the necessities of this day. Do small tasks without complaint, for they are small. Follow your procedure today in preparation, for it is necessary and it is great. Do not confuse the great and the small, for the small is only to express the great. Do not try to make the small great or the great small. Understand their true relationship with one another, for within you is both the great and the small. Within you, the great wishes to express itself through the small. </p><p>因此，欢迎今天的必要性。做一些小事，不要抱怨，因为它们很小。按照今天的程序做好准备，因为这是必要的，也是伟大的。不要混淆伟大和渺小，因为渺小只是为了表达伟大。不要试图让渺小变得伟大，也不要试图让伟大变得渺小。理解它们之间的真实关系，因为在你的内心既有伟大，也有渺小。在你的内心，伟大希望通过渺小来表达自己。</p><p>Therefore, carry out your mundane activities today. Do what is necessary today. Remind yourself upon the hour of Our idea for today, and give yourself to your practice so that your day may be a day of giving and receiving. In your deeper meditation practices, enter into stillness using the word RAHN to take you deep into meditation. Do this because it is necessary. Do this with necessity and you will feel the power of your own will.</p><p>因此，今天就开展你的日常活动吧。做今天必须做的事。在我们今天的想法的时刻提醒自己，全身心地投入到实践中去，这样你的一天就会成为给予与收到的一天。在更深的冥想练习中，用RAHN这个词进入静止状态，带你深入冥想。这样做是因为有必要。在必要时这样做，你会感受到自己意志的力量。</p><p>Practice 173: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 173 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百七十二阶：我必须找回我的内识</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/15/172/"/>
      <url>/2024/09/15/172/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-172-I-must-reclaim-my-Knowledge"><a href="#Step-172-I-must-reclaim-my-Knowledge" class="headerlink" title="Step 172 I must reclaim my Knowledge."></a>Step 172 I must reclaim my Knowledge.</h2><p>You must reclaim your Knowledge. It is not merely a preference in competition with other preferences.  The fact that it is a requirement in life gives it the necessity and the importance that it truly deserves. Think not that your freedom is in any way hindered by this necessity, for your freedom is the result of this necessity and will be born of this necessity. Here you enter a world of vital direction rather than casual choices. Here you become seriously engaged in life rather than a removed observer who can only witness your own ideas.</p><p>你必须找回你的内识。它不仅仅是与其他喜好相竞争的喜好。它是生命的必需，这赋予了它真正应有的必要性和重要性。不要认为你的自由会受到这种必要性的任何阻碍，因为你的自由是这种必要性的结果，也将诞生于这种必要性。在这里，你进入的是一个有重要方向的世界，而不是随意选择的世界。在这里，你将认真地参与生命，而不是一个只能见证自己想法的冷眼旁观者。</p><p>The necessity of Knowledge, then, is the importance that it bears for you and for your world. Welcome necessity, then, for it frees you from the aggravation and the disability of ambivalence. It rescues you from meaningless choices and directs you to that which is truly vital for your well-being and for the well-being of the world. Knowledge is a necessity. Your life is a necessity. Its importance is not merely for you alone, but for the world as well.</p><p>因此，内识的必要性就在于它对你和你的世界所具有的重要性。因此，内识的必要性值得欢迎，因为它能让你摆脱矛盾的痛苦和残疾。它把你从无意义的选择中解救出来，引导你去寻找对你和世界的福祉真正重要的工作。内识是必要的。你的生命也是必要的。它的重要性不仅在于你自己，也是为了整个世界。</p><p>If you can comprehend this in truth, this will override any sense of unworthiness or indolence that you may still possess. For if your life is a necessity, then it has purpose, meaning and direction. If your life is a necessity, then all other lives are a necessity as well. In this, you will wish to harm no one but instead will seek to affirm Knowledge in everyone. This necessity, then, bears with it the strength and the direction that you require and provides you with the grace and depth that you must receive for yourself. A necessary life is a meaningful life. Knowledge is a necessity. Give yourself to your necessity, and you will feel that you are a necessity yourself. This will dispel your sense of unworthiness and guilt and bring you back into relationship with life.</p><p>如果你能领会这个真理，这将会超越你可能仍然拥有的任何不值得或懒惰的感觉。因为如果你的生命有了必要性，那么它就有了目的、意义和方向。如果你的生命是必要的，那么其他所有生命也都是必要的。在这一点上，你不希望伤害任何人，反而会努力肯定每个人的内识。因此，这种必要性承载着你所需要的力量和方向，并为你提供了你自己必须接受的恩典和深度。必要的生命才是有意义的生命。内识是一种必需。把自己交给你的必需，你就会觉得自己是必要的。这将消除你的不配感和负罪感，让你重新回到与生命的关系中。</p><p>Practice again upon the hour, and in your two meditation practices allow the word RAHN to take you deeper into the presence of Knowledge itself. The power of this word, a word unknown within your own language, will resonate with your Knowledge and will stimulate it. Thus, the means are mysterious, but the result is concrete.</p><p>每小时再次练习，在你两次的冥想练习中，让词语“RAHN”将你带入内识本身的存在感。这个词语的力量，一个在你语言中未知的词语，将与你的内识产生共鸣并激发它。因此，方法是神秘的，但结果是具体的。</p><p>Practice 172: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 172 ：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百七十一阶：我的给予是对自己财富的肯定</title>

It is not  the giving of objects that We speak of here, for you may give away all your possessions and then have none left over. But when you give Knowledge, Knowledge increases. And when you imbue your gift of an object with Knowledge, Knowledge increases. That is why when you receive Knowledge, you will want to give it because this is the natural expression of your own receptivity. </p><p>你的给予是对自己财富的肯定，因为你是在用自己的财富给予的。我们在这里所说的给予并不是物品的给予，因为你可能会给予掉你所有的财产，然后一无所有。但当你给予内识时，内识就会增加。当你在赠送物品时注入内识，内识也会增加。这就是为什么当你接受内识时，你会想要给予它，因为这是你自身接纳能力的自然体现。</p><p>How can you exhaust Knowledge when Knowledge is the Power and the Will of the universe? How small your vehicle, how great the substance that expresses itself through you. How great your relationship with life, and how great, then, are you who are with life. There is no conceit here. There is no self-inflation here, for you realize that you are small and great all at once, and you acknowledge the source of your smallness and the source of your greatness. You acknowledge the value of your smallness and the value of your greatness. You acknowledge all life, then, and nothing is left out of your great evaluation of yourself, which is born of love and true understanding. This, then, is the understanding that you must cultivate over time, realizing again that your efforts to do so are embellished by the efforts of others who are also students of Knowledge in your world. Even students in other worlds embellish your efforts, for in Knowledge there is no time and distance. Thus, you have great support available to you now, and in this you realize your true relationship with life.</p><p>内识是宇宙的力量和意志，你怎能穷尽内识？你的载体何其渺小，但通过你展现的实质却是如此伟大。你与生命的关系是如此伟大，因此，当你与生命同在时，你的伟大也得以体现。这里没有自负。这里没有自我膨胀，因为你意识到自己既渺小又伟大，你承认自己渺小的根源，也承认自己伟大的来源。你承认自己渺小的价值，也承认自己伟大的价值。于是，你承认所有的生命，在对自己进行伟大的评估时，没有任何生命是被遗漏的，这种评价源于爱和真实的理解。因此，这就是你必须长期培养的理解力，你要再次意识到，你的努力会得到你的世界里同样是内识学生的其他人的努力的点缀。即使是其他世界的学生也会点缀你的努力，因为在内识中没有时间和距离。因此，你现在可以得到巨大的支持，并从中认识到自己与生命的真实关系。</p><p>Practice upon the hour and in your deeper meditations, allow the word RAHN to take you into Knowledge. Silently and in stillness, as you sink into the depths of Knowledge, receive the peace and the confirmation that are your birthright.</p><p>在每小时的练习中，在更深层面的冥想中，让RAHN这个词带你进入内识。静静地沉入内识的深处，接受与生俱来的和平与肯定。</p><p>Practice 171: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 171： 两次 30 分钟的练习。每小时练习一次。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百七十阶：今天，我会遵循古老的准备仪式</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/15/170/"/>

It has been used for centuries, in this world and in other worlds as well. It is only adapted in its language and in its relevancy to your current time, yet it prepares the mind in the way that minds have always been prepared in The Way of Knowledge, for Knowledge does not change and the preparations only adapt themselves to current events and current understanding so that they may be relevant for the recipients. Yet the true mechanism for preparation is unchanged.</p><p>你所进行的这项准备源自古老的传承。几个世纪以来，它被运用在这个世界和其他世界中。它只是在语言和与当今时局的关联性上做了调整，但它仍然以内识之路的方式来培养心灵，因为内识不会改变，准备工作只是根据当前的事件和当前的理解进行调整，以便与受教育者相关。然而，准备工作的真实机制并没有改变。</p><p>You are undertaking an Ancient Rite in the reclamation of Knowledge. Born of the Great Will of the universe, this preparation has been constructed for the advancement of students of Knowledge. You are working in tandem now with many other individuals, both within this world and within other worlds as well. For Knowledge is being taught in all worlds where intelligent life exists. Thus, your efforts are supported and embellished by the efforts of those who are preparing with you. In this, you represent a community of learners. Think not, then, that your efforts are singular. Think not, then, that you are alone in the world undertaking the reclamation of Knowledge. Think not, then, that you are not part of a community of learners. This will be more evident to you in time as you begin to recognize those who are preparing with you. This will be more evident in time as your experience of the presence of your Teachers deepens. This will be more evident in time as the results of your Knowledge become evident even to you. This will be more evident in time as you consider your life as part of a Greater Community of worlds.</p><p>你正在通过这项古老的仪式进行内识的恢复。这项准备源自宇宙的伟大意志，为了内识的学生们而构建。你现在正与许多其他个体同步工作，不仅在这个世界，还有其他世界也是如此。因为内识在所有有智能生命存在的世界中都被教授。因此，你的努力得到了与之共同准备的智能生命的支持和增强。在这点上，你代表了一群学习者。所以，不要认为你的努力是孤立的。不要认为你是孤独地在世界上进行内识的恢复。不要认为你不是一个学习群体的一员。随着时间的推移，当你开始认出那些与你一起准备的人时，这一点会变得更加明显。随着你的老师存在感的加深，这一点也会变得更加明显。随着你内识成果的显现，这一点甚至会对你自己变得更加明显。随着你逐渐将自己的生命视为世界大社区的一部分，这一点也会变得更加明显。</p><p>Remind yourself of your practice upon the hour. In your deeper practices in stillness, receive the benefit of all who practice with you. Remind yourself that you are not alone and that their rewards are given to you as your rewards are given to them. Thus, you share in your accomplishments together. The power of your undertaking is so tremendously supported by the endeavor and the giving of others that it far exceeds your own abilities. When this is realized, it will give you all manner of encouragement and will banish forever the idea that you are inadequate to the tasks that are given to you. For your giving is supplemented by the giving of others, and this represents the Will of God in the universe.</p><p>提醒自己每时每刻都在练习。在更深入的静心练习中，接受所有与你一起练习的内识学生的益处。提醒自己，你并不孤单，他们给你的回报也是你给他们的回报。因此，你们共同分享成就。他人的努力和付出会极大地支持你的事业，使其远远超出你自身的能力。当你意识到这一点时，你就会得到各种鼓励，并永远消除自己不足以完成任务的想法。因为你的给予得到了他人的补充，这代表了上帝在宇宙中的意志。</p><p>Practice 170: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 170 ：两个30分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

This I know."></a>Step 169 The world is within me. This I know.</h2><p>The world is within you. You can feel it. Through Knowledge you can feel the presence of all relationships. This is the experience of God. This is why your meaningful relationships with other individuals hold such great promise, for in genuine union with another you can begin to experience union with all life. This is why you genuinely seek relationships. This is your true motivation in relationships—to experience union and to express your purpose. People think that their relationships are to fulfill their fantasies and to fortify themselves against their own anxiety. This must be unlearned so that the true purpose of relationships may be revealed and comprehended. Thus, unlearning comes first in the process of learning. In this, you learn how to learn. In this, you learn how to receive.</p><p>世界就在你的内心深处。你能感受到它。通过内识，你能感受到所有关系的存在。这就是上帝的体验。这就是为什么你与其他人的有意义的关系具有如此伟大的承诺，因为在与他人的真正结合中，你可以开始体验与所有生命的结合。这就是你真正寻求关系的原因。这是你在关系中的真实动机——体验结合，表达你的目的。人们认为，关系是为了满足自己的幻想，是为了强化自己，抵御自己的焦虑。你必须摒弃这种想法，这样才能揭示和理解关系的真实目的。因此，在学习的过程中，首先要解除学习。在这个过程中，你学会了如何学习。在这个过程中，你学会了如何接受。</p><p>Practice upon the hour this day, remembering your idea. Today in your deeper meditations, once again use the word RAHN to take you deeper into the depth of Knowledge. Repeat the idea at the beginning of your practice and then, upon each exhale, repeat the word RAHN quietly to yourself. Allow this to center your mind. Allow this to connect you with the depth of Knowledge. Here you go deeper than you have gone before. In this, you will find all that you seek, and there will be no confusion about the world.</p><p>在今天的每个小时中，记住你的想法，进行练习。今天，在深入冥想时，再次使用RAHN这个词，带你深入内识。在开始练习时，重复这个想法，然后在每次呼气时，对自己轻声重复RAHN这个词。使你的心灵集中。让它将你与内识的深度连接起来。在这里，你会走得比以前更深。在这里，你会找到你所寻求的一切，对世界也不会感到困惑。</p><p>Practice 169: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 169： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Review each lesson as it was given and each practice that you experienced. Review the entire week so that you may fortify the learning that you are now undertaking. Remember that you are learning to learn. Remember that you are a beginning student of Knowledge. Remember that your evaluation, if it is not born of Knowledge, will not be helpful. Without this evaluation, it will be apparent how to strengthen your involvement, how to strengthen your preparation and how to make adjustments in your outer life to support you in your endeavor. This can be done without self-condemnation. It can be done because it is necessary, and you are able to respond to that which is necessary without punishing yourself or the world. This preparation is necessary, for it represents your will.</p><p>回顾过去的一周。回顾所学的每一课和所经历的每一次练习。回顾整个一周，这样你就能巩固现在正在进行的学习。记住，你是为了学习而学习。记住你是内识的初学者。记住，如果你的评价不是源于内识，那么它将不会有任何帮助。没有这种评估，如何加强你的参与，如何加强你的准备，如何调整你的外在生活以支持你的努力就会显而易见。这样做时不必自责。你可以这样做，因为这是必要的，而且你能够对必要的事情做出反应，而不会惩罚自己或这个世界。这种准备是必要的，因为它代表了你的意志。</p><p>In your long practice period today, review the week with sincerity and depth.

You are free to join. You are free to leave. You are free to make agreements. You are free to complete and change agreements. You are free to surrender yourself. You are free to extricate yourself. In Knowledge you are free.</p><p>有了内识，你在世界上是自由的。你可以自由加入。你可以自由离开。你可以自由地达成协议。你有完成和改变协议的自由。你有交出自己的自由。你可以自由解脱。在内识中，你是自由的。</p><p>In order for you to comprehend the true meaning of this and to realize its immediate value to you in your current circumstances, you must understand that you cannot use Knowledge to fulfill yourself. That must be a tacit understanding. Never lose sight of this, for if you think you are using Knowledge to fulfill yourself, you will misinterpret Knowledge and will not experience it. You will merely attempt to fortify your illusions and your attempts at escape. This can only darken the clouds that are now cast over you. This can only disappoint you as a form of temporary stimulation and compound your sense of isolation and misery.</p><p>为了让你理解这句话的真正含义，并意识到它在你当前情况下对你的直接价值，你必须明白，你不能用内识来实现你自己。这必须是一种默契。千万不要忽视这一点，因为如果你认为自己是在利用内识来实现自我，你就会曲解内识，也就无法体验内识。你只会试图强化自己的幻想和逃避的企图。这只会让现在笼罩在你们头上的乌云更加阴暗。这只会让你失望，成为一种暂时的刺激，加剧你的孤独感和痛苦感。</p><p>In Knowledge you are free. There is no restraint now, for Knowledge will merely give you where you are intended to be given and express itself through you where it is intended to be expressed. This will free you from all inappropriate involvements and engagements and will lead you to those individuals who are waiting for you. This will lead you to those circumstances that are for your greatest benefit and for the benefit of others who are involved. Here Knowledge is the guide. Here you are the recipient. Here you are the contributor. There is no greater freedom than this, for in this you are free.</p><p>在内识中，你是自由的。现在没有束缚，因为内识只会在你想要被给予的地方给予你，并通过你在它想要表达的地方表达它自己。这将把你从所有不恰当的参与和约定中解放出来，并将把你引向那些等待着你的人。这将把你引向那些对你最有利的环境，以及对其他参与者有利的环境。在这里，内识是向导。在这里，你是接受者。在这里，你是贡献者。没有比这更大的自由了，因为在这里你是自由的。</p><p>Remind yourself of this idea upon the hour, and in your two deeper meditation practices, once again enter into stillness and silence. Once again allow your mind to be quiet, for in this you are free. Prepare yourself for your practices by repeating the idea and dedicating yourself to your practice. Without your domination, your mind will be free and will experience its own depth in Knowledge.</p><p>每到一小时，提醒自己记住这个想法，在两次更深的冥想练习中，再次进入静止和沉默。再一次让你的心灵安静下来，因为这样你才是自由的。重复这个想法，为你的练习做好准备，全身心地投入练习。没有了你的主宰，你的心灵将获得自由，并在内识中体验自身的深度。</p><p>Practice 167: Two 30-minute practice periods.

      <title>第一百六十六阶：我的使命是伟大的。因此，我可以自由地做小事。</title>

Therefore, I am free to do small things."></a>Step 166  My mission is great. Therefore, I am free to do small things.</h2><p>It is only in your grandiose ideas, which are a cover for fear, anxiety and despair, that you would avoid the small things that are required of you to do in the world. Again, do not confuse the greatness of your mission with the smallness of your duties. Greatness expresses itself in the smallest thing, in the tiniest action, in the most fleeting thought, in the simplest gesture and in the most mundane circumstances. Thus, maintain your small actions in the world so that Knowledge in time may express itself through them. Actions in the world are small in contrast to the greatness of Knowledge. Prior to your preparation, the world was considered great and Knowledge small, but you are now learning that the opposite is true—that Knowledge is great and the world is small. This also means that your activities in the world are small, but they are vehicles through which Knowledge may express itself.</p><p>只有在你的宏伟想法中，你才会回避在这个世界上需要你做的小事，而这些想法只是恐惧、焦虑和绝望的幌子。同样，不要把你使命的伟大与你职责的渺小混为一谈。伟大体现在最微小的事情中，体现在最细微的行动中，体现在最短暂的感想中，体现在最简单的姿态中，体现在最平凡的环境中。因此，保持你在世界上的微小行动，以便及时内识可以通过它们表达自己。与内识的伟大相比，世间的行动是渺小的。在你做好准备之前，世界被认为是伟大的，而内识是渺小的，但你现在正学习的事实恰恰相反——内识是伟大的，而世界是渺小的。这也意味着，你在世界上的活动是渺小的，但它们是内识表达自身的载体。</p><p>Therefore, be content doing small things in the world. Be simple and humble in the world so that greatness may flow through you without obstruction.</p><p>因此，要满足于在世界上做小事。在这个世界上要简单、谦逊，这样伟大的力量才能在你身上畅通无阻。</p><p>This practice will require repetition upon the hour and deep consideration in your two longer practice periods, where you will engage your mind actively in comprehending the meaning of today’s idea. Use your mind for investigation. Allow yourself to consider these things. Do not rely on conclusions but continue your exploration. This is the right use of your mind which will lead you to a greater understanding. Here the mind is not merely weaving visions and illusions to take itself away from its own anxiety. Here the mind is examining its own content. Here the mind is working on behalf of Knowledge, as it was intended to do.</p><p>这种练习需要在一小时内反复练习，并在两个较长的练习时间内进行深入思考，在这段时间内，你将积极调动你的心灵来理解今天的想法的含义。用你的心灵去探究。让自己考虑这些事情。不要依赖结论，而是继续探索。这是对心灵的正确运用，它将引导你加深理解。在这里，心灵不仅仅是在编织幻象和虚幻，以摆脱自身的焦虑。在这里，心灵正在审视自身的内容。在这里，心灵代表内识工作，这是它的本意。</p><p>Practice 166: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 166： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

My mission is great."></a>Step 165  My duties are small. My mission is great.</h2><p>Your duties in the world are small. They are meant to secure provisions which you need physically  and to maintain those alliances with others that are beneficial for your well-being and for their well-being as well. These duties are important, but your mission is greater. Do not undermine your ability to receive your mission by being in failure concerning your duties. This is only a form of self-avoidance. Carry out your duties specifically this day regarding your employment and your engagement with others. Do not confuse this with your mission, which is something far greater that you are only now beginning to receive and to experience. Thus, your duties will provide a foundation for you as you undertake the preparation for the reclamation and the contribution of Knowledge.</p><p>你在这个世界上的职责很小。它们的目的是确保你身体所需的供给，并与他人保持有利于你和他人福祉的联盟。这些职责固然重要，但你的使命更为重大。不要因为失职而影响你完成使命的能力。这只是一种自我逃避。今天，你要具体履行你的职责，包括工作和与他人的交往。不要把这与你的使命混为一谈，你的使命远比你现在才开始接受和体验的要伟大得多。因此，你的职责将为你进行开垦和贡献内识的准备工作奠定基础。</p><p>Remember that all confusion is the confusion of different levels. Do not confuse mission with duty. This is a very important distinction for you to make. Your tasks in the world are specific, but your mission is far greater. As your mission begins to express itself within you who are learning to receive it, it will create a more specific influence upon your duties as well. This is gradual and entirely natural for you. This merely requires that you be self-disciplined, consistent and trusting enough to follow its steps.</p><p>请记住，所有的困惑都是不同层级的困惑。不要混淆使命与责任。这是一个非常重要的区别。你在这个世界上的任务是具体的，但你的使命要伟大得多。当你的使命开始在学习接受它的你身上表现出来时，它也会对你的职责产生更具体的影响。这对你来说是渐进的，也是完全自然的。这只需要你自律、坚持不懈、足够信任地跟随它的脚步。</p><p>Therefore, carry out your duties today so that you may be a beginning student of Knowledge. Remind yourself of your practice upon the hour, and in your two longer practice periods, actively engage your mind in considering the idea for today. Its true meaning is not superficial, and you must investigate it to understand its full value. Do not be complacent with premature conclusions. Do not stand on the outside of Knowledge and attempt to judge it for yourself. Enter into it so that you may be a student today, for you are now a student of Knowledge. You are now giving yourself to the world in your preparation.</p><p>因此，履行你今天的职责，让自己成为一名内识的初学者。提醒自己每时每刻都要进行练习，在两次较长时间的练习中，积极地让自己的心灵思考今天的想法。它的真实含义并不肤浅，你必须对它进行研究，才能理解它的全部价值。不要自满于过早的结论。不要站在内识的外面，试图自己去评判它。进入其中，这样你今天就可以成为一名学生，因为你现在是一名内识的学生。在准备过程中，您正在将自己奉献给世界。</p><p>Practice 165: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 165： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Learn more of the process of learning. Realize that to learn this you cannot view your life with condemnation, for you are learning to learn. Realize that wealth is apparent in your life because of the practices that you are undertaking, which you could not do if you were without Knowledge. You are undertaking this preparation because of Knowledge, and each day you are committed to your practice because of Knowledge. Each day you accomplish your practice because of Knowledge. Thus, without your denial or interference, Knowledge itself will guide you in your preparation and will emerge as you undertake each step. How easy is success in this way. How simple it is to receive without denial or insistence on your part. For without imagination, life is evident. Its beauty is evident. Its grace is evident. Its purpose is evident. The work that it requires is evident. Its rewards are evident. Even the difficulties of this world are evident. Everything becomes evident as your mind becomes still and clear.</p><p>在今天的回顾中，回顾过去一周的每节课和每天的练习。进一步了解学习的过程。认识到要学会这些，你就不能用谴责的眼光看待自己的生活，因为你是在学习中学习。认识到财富在你的生命中是显而易见的，因为你正在进行的实践，如果没有内识，你是做不到的。因为有了内识，你才会进行这种准备，因为有了内识，你才会每天致力于实践。因为内识，你每天都在完成自己的练习。因此，不用你否认或干涉，内识本身就会指导你进行准备，并在你进行每一步时浮现出来。这样，成功是多么容易。无需否认，无需坚持，接纳是多么简单。因为没有想象，生命是显而易见的。它的美丽显而易见。它的恩典显而易见。它的目的显而易见。它所要求的工作显而易见。它的回报是显而易见的。甚至这个世界的困难也是显而易见的。当你的心灵变得沉静和清澈时，一切都变得显而易见。</p><p>Therefore, in one long practice period review the week’s practices.

Regardless of your circumstances, this is true because you are reclaiming the wealth of Knowledge. Understand, then, the meaning of impoverishment. Understand, then, the meaning of wealth. Do not think that those who possess more objects than you are in any way wealthier than you are, for without Knowledge they are impoverished and will acquire things only to offset their misery and uncertainty. Thus, their impoverishment is compounded by their acquisition.</p><p>世界是贫穷的，但你并不贫穷。无论你的境遇如何，这都是真实的，因为你正在开垦内识的财富。因此，请理解贫穷的含义。然后，请理解财富的含义。不要认为那些比你拥有更多物品的人在任何方面都比你富有，因为没有内识，他们是贫穷的，获得物品只是为了抵消他们的痛苦和不确定性。因此，他们的贫穷会因为他们的获取而加剧。</p><p>The world is poor, but you are not, for you have brought Knowledge with you into the world where Knowledge has been forgotten and denied. Thus, in the reclamation of your own wealth, the world will reclaim its wealth as well, for you shall stimulate Knowledge in all, and their wealth will begin to reveal itself in your presence and in the presence of Knowledge which guides you.</p><p>世界是贫穷的，但你不是，因为你把内识带入了这个内识被遗忘和否认的世界。因此，在开垦你自己的财富时，世界也将开垦它的财富，因为你将激发所有人的内识，他们的财富将在你和引导你的内识面前开始显现。</p><p>Therefore, do not ask anything of the world save what few material things you need to fulfill your function. This is a small request in light of what you have come to give.

You will have exactly what you need, and the world will not burden you with its deprivation or its excesses. Thus, everything will have perfect balance.

Any other action, any other favor, any other object that is a gift is only meaningful insofar as it is imbued with Knowledge. This is the unseen essence of all true gifts and all true giving. You have a great storehouse of this essence, which you must learn to receive. You are rich beyond your own awareness. Even if you are financially poor, even if you think you are alone, you are rich. Your giving will demonstrate this today. Your giving will demonstrate the source, the depth and the meaning of your wealth and will imbue all of your giving with the essence of giving itself.

The world sets a poor example for this, for humanity has lost its relationship with life and now seeks desperately within the realms of imagination and fantasy to find that which has been lost. Be happy today, then, that the means for life’s reclamation have been given to you so that you may give yourself to your practice and to your destiny. In this way, you are affirmed. You are not alone in the universe. The depth of this idea is far greater than what it appears to be at first.

Attempt to feel it in whatever circumstance you find yourself. In your two longer meditation practices, attempt to experience your complete inclusion in life. You need not think of ideas or see images, but only feel the presence of life of which you are a part. You are within life. You are immersed in life. Life is embracing you. Beyond any images the world may present, beyond any actions the world may demonstrate, you are within the loving embrace of life.</p><p>因此，每当此时，请提醒自己这句话。无论你身处何种环境，都要尝试去感受它。在两次较长时间的冥想练习中，尝试体验自己完全融入生命的感觉。你不需要思考想法或看到图像，只需要感受生命的存在，你是生命的一部分。你就在生命之中。你沉浸在生命的怀抱。生命正在拥抱你。超越世界可能呈现的任何形象，超越世界可能展示的任何行动，你正在生命之爱的怀抱中。</p><p>Practice 157: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 157： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百五十六阶：今天，我不会关注自我</title>
      <link href="/2024/09/01/156/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-156-I-will-not-be-concerned-about-myself-today"><a href="#Step-156-I-will-not-be-concerned-about-myself-today" class="headerlink" title="Step 156  I will not be concerned about myself today."></a>Step 156  I will not be concerned about myself today.</h2><p>Self-concern is a form of habitual thinking, born of negative imagination and of errors that have not been corrected. This compounds your sense of failure, thus influencing your lack of self-trust and self-appreciation. Our lesson for today, then, is to fortify that which is genuine within you. If you are with Knowledge, Knowledge will care for all things that require your attention. Think not that anything will be left unattended to that is for your own behalf. All needs of a greater spiritual nature and of the most mundane nature as well will be met and understood by you, for there is no neglect in Knowledge. You who are accustomed to neglect, who have not used your mind properly in the past, who have not been able to see or hear the world, can now be comforted, for you need not have concern for yourself today.</p><p>自我关注是一种习惯性思维，源于消极的想象和尚未纠正的错误。这会加重你的失败感，从而影响你缺乏自我信任和自我欣赏。那么，我们今天的课程就是强化你内心的真诚。如果你与内识同在，内识就会关注所有需要你关注的事物。不要认为有什么事情会因为你自己而被忽视。所有精神层面和世俗层面的需求都会得到满足和理解，因为内识不会忽视。那些习惯于被忽视的人，那些过去没有正确使用心智的人，那些无法看到或听到这个世界的人，现在可以得到安慰了，因为你今天不需要为自己担忧。</p><p>For this you must extend your faith and your trust that Knowledge will provide for you. This in time will allow you to receive the gift of Knowledge, which will dispel all doubt and confusion. You must prepare for this experience. In this, you must extend your faith and trust. Be confident this day. Recognize those things that require your attention, even if they be of a mundane nature, and attend to them well, for Knowledge is not seeking to take you out of the world but to bring you into the world, for you have come here to give.</p><p>为此，你必须坚定信念，相信内识会为你提供帮助。假以时日，你将获得内识的礼物，它将消除所有的怀疑和困惑。你必须为此做好准备。为此，你必须坚定信念和信任。今天要充满信心。认清那些需要你关注的事情，即使是平凡的事情，也要认真对待，因为内识并不是要带你离开这个世界，而是要带你进入这个世界，因为你来到这里是为了给予。</p><p>Fortify your understanding of today’s idea by repeating it upon the hour and giving it a moment of true consideration. Fortify your practice today by utilizing it in your deeper practices where you enter stillness and silence. You can only enter stillness and silence if you are without concern for yourself. Thus, your commitment to give yourself to your practice is an affirmation of the safety and the certainty that abide with you.</p><p>通过每时每刻重复今天的想法，并给予它片刻真正的思考，来加强你对它的理解。在你进入静止和沉默的深入练习中使用它，加强你今天的练习。只有当你不关心自己时，你才能进入静止和沉默。因此，你为自己的实践付出的承诺，就是对与你同在的安全感和确定性的肯定。</p><p>Practice 156: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 156： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

You were created to be an extension of  your Source. You were created to be a part of your Source. Your life is communication, for communication is life. Communication is the extension of Knowledge. It is not merely the sharing of little ideas from one separated mind to another. Communication is far greater, for communication creates life and extends life, and within this is all joy and fulfillment. Within this is the depth of all meaning. Here darkness and light mix together and cease their separation. Here all opposites blend and melt into each other. This is the unity of all life.</p><p>你被创造出来，就是为了表达你的本源。你被创造出来，就是为了成为本源的延伸。你被创造出来，就是为了成为你的本源的一部分。你的生命就是交流，因为交流就是生命。交流是内识的延伸。它不仅仅是一个分离的心灵与另一个分离的心灵分享一些想法。交流远不止于此，因为交流创造了生命，延伸了生命，其中蕴含着所有的喜悦和满足。这就是一切意义的深度所在。在这里，黑暗与光明混合在一起，不再分离。在这里，所有的对立面都相互融合，融为一体。这就是所有生命的统一。</p><p>Allow yourself, then, to experience yourself as a vehicle of communication, and know what you truly wish to communicate will be fully expressed as well, for the self that you genuinely are is an extension of the Self that is life itself. In this, you will be completely affirmed and life will be affirmed around you. Your gifts will be received and integrated by life, for giving of this nature can only yield a greater result, beyond the comprehension of humanity.</p><p>因此，允许自己体验作为沟通载体的自我，并明白你真正想要传达的内识也将得到充分表达，因为你真实的自我是生命它本身的延伸。在此过程中，你将得到完全的肯定，生命也将在你周围得到肯定。你的礼物将被生命接收并融入其中，因为这种性质的给予只能带来更大的结果，超越人类的理解。</p><p>Remind yourself upon the hour that you were meant to express the will of your Source. Within your two practice periods today, allow yourself to enter stillness and peace once again. Allow yourself to be an open vehicle through which life may flow freely, through which life may express itself today.</p><p>时刻提醒自己，你的使命就是表达本源的意志。在今天的两次练习中，让自己再次进入静止与平和。让自己成为一个开放的载体，让生命可以自由流动，让生命在今天通过你表达自己。</p><p>Practice 153: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Do not follow the waves of fear that move across the world. Instead, remain steadfast and still in Knowledge. Allow yourself to observe the world from this point of stillness and certainty. Do not be swayed by the waves of fear. In this way, you will be able to contribute to the world and not be its victim only. You are here to give, not to judge, and in stillness you are without judgment upon the world. Recognize, then, the waves of fear, but do not let them touch you, for in Knowledge they cannot touch you because Knowledge is beyond all fear.</p><p>人类被恐惧的浪潮所支配，恐惧的浪潮把人们引向这里又引向那里，恐惧的浪潮支配着人们的行动、思维、结论、信念和假设。不要跟随在世界各地蔓延的恐惧浪潮。相反，要在内识中保持坚定和静止。让自己从这种静止和确定的角度来观察世界。不要被恐惧的浪潮所左右。这样，你就能为世界做出贡献，而不仅仅是世界的牺牲品。你是来给予的，而不是来评判的，在静止的状态下，你对世界没有评判。认识到恐惧的浪潮，但不要让它们触及你，因为在内识中，它们无法触及你，因为内识超越了一切恐惧。</p><p>Repeat your idea for the day upon the hour, and consider it in light of all that you experience today. In your two longer practice periods, apply your mind actively in attempting to understand today’s lesson. Again, this is a form of mental application. We shall not practice stillness and mental silence today but mental application so that you may learn to think constructively. For when your mind is not still, it should be thinking constructively. It should be investigating. Do not rely upon early conclusions. Do not rely upon self-comforting ideas. Allow yourself to be vulnerable today, for you are only vulnerable to Knowledge. Yet Knowledge will shield you from all things of harm within this world and will provide a comfort and a stability that the world can never change. Learn of this today so that you may be a source of Knowledge within the world so that your Source may express itself through you.</p><p>每隔一小时重复一次你今天的想法，并结合你今天所经历的一切进行思考。在两次较长时间的练习中，积极运用你的心灵，尝试理解今天的课程。同样，这也是心灵运用的一种形式。我们今天要练习的不是静止和心静，而是心灵的运用，这样你才能学会建设性地思考。因为当你的心灵不保持静心时，它应该是在进行建设性的思考。它应该进行研究。不要依赖过早的结论。不要依赖自我安慰的想法。今天，请允许自己变得脆弱，因为你只对内识脆弱。然而，内识会保护你免受世间万物的伤害，并为你提供世界永远无法改变的安慰和稳定。今天就学习这些，让你成为世界上的内识源泉，让你的源泉通过你来表达它自己。</p><p>Practice 152: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Thus, they lack the foundation of Knowledge. Thus, they lack the meaning and value that only Knowledge can bestow. Do not rely upon your judgments of yourself and the world. As you withdraw from them, you will realize that their source is fear, for you have only been trying to comfort yourself with your judgments, to provide a false security, stability and identity which you feel you are lacking. Therefore, be without a substitute for Wisdom and Knowledge, and allow Wisdom and Knowledge to arise naturally.</p><p>不要用恐惧来支持你对自己和世界的判断，因为这些判断源于你的不确定和焦虑。因此，它们缺乏内识的基础。因此，它们缺乏只有内识才能赋予的意义和价值。不要依赖你对自己和世界的判断。当你从这些判断中抽身出来时，你就会认识到它们的根源是恐惧，因为你只是试图用你的判断来安慰自己，为自己提供一种虚假的安全感、稳定感和认同感，而这正是你所缺乏的。因此，不要让智慧和内识代替你，让智慧和内识自然产生。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat your statement, and consider it in light of all things that are occurring today. In your two deeper practices, consider the meaning of today’s idea as you think about it carefully. Apply your mind in a state of work as you attempt to penetrate the meaning of today’s lesson. Do not be comforted by premature conclusions. Investigate deeply with your mind in your practice periods. Use your mind actively. Consider many things within yourself while maintaining a concentration on today’s idea. If you do this, you will understand many things about wisdom and ignorance, and your understanding will be born of compassion and true selfappreciation. For only from a place of self-love can you offer correction to yourself and to others.</p><p>每小时重复一次你的陈述，并结合今天发生的所有事情进行思考。在你的两次深入练习中，仔细思考今天的想法的意义。当你试图深入理解今天课程的意义时，将你的心灵运用到工作状态中。不要过早下结论。在练习期间用心深入探究。积极运用你的心灵。在专注于今天所学内容的同时，考虑自己内心的许多事情。如果你这样做了，你就会明白许多关于智慧和无知的事情，你的理解将源于同情和真正的自我欣赏。因为只有从自爱的角度出发，你才能修正自己和他人。</p><p>Practice 151: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You learn to learn because you need to learn. You need to learn how to learn so that your learning may be effective and expedient, have depth and consistency and produce a sound advancement that you can rely upon in all circumstances in the future. Do not think that you already understand the process of learning, for you are learning about this now as you understand the meaning of advancement, the meaning of failure, the meaning of encouragement, the meaning of discouragement, the meaning of enthusiasm and the meaning of a lack of enthusiasm. That is why at the end of each week you review your practices so that you may understand your progress and understand the mechanism of learning. This is essential for you to realize, for until you do, you will misinterpret your steps, you will misconstrue your actions, you will not understand how to follow a curriculum and you will never learn how to teach a curriculum yourself.</p><p>今天，你要学会学习。你要学会学习，因为你需要学习。你需要学会如何学习，这样你的学习才会有效而便捷，才会有深度和连贯性，才会产生稳健的进步，让你在未来的任何情况下都可以信赖。不要认为你已经理解了学习的过程，因为你现在正在学习理解进步的意义，失败的意义，鼓励的意义，沮丧的意义，热情的意义，以及缺乏热情的意义。这就是为什么在每周结束时，你需要回顾你的练习，以便理解你的进步，并理解学习的机制。这对你来说至关重要，因为直到你做到这一点，你才不会误解自己的步骤，不会误解自己的行动，才能理解如何遵循课程，并最终学会如何自己教授课程。</p><p>Therefore, today you learn to learn. This places you as a beginning student of Knowledge, which gives you all rights and all encouragement to learn everything that is necessary, without presumption, without conceit, without denial and without falsity of any kind. As you learn to learn, you will realize the mechanism of learning. This will give you wisdom and compassion in your dealings with people. You cannot teach people from idealism, for then you place upon them the burden of your own expectations. You require of them what even life cannot provide. But the certainty of your experience and your Knowledge, which you will give to others, will be sound, and they will be able to receive it and utilize it in their own way. Then you will not place any personal demands upon them in their learning, but will allow Knowledge within you to give to Knowledge in them. You will then be a witness to the instruction and to the learning as well. </p><p>因此，今天你要学会学习。这使你成为内识的初学者，并赋予你一切权利和鼓励，让你学习一切必要的知识，不妄自菲薄，不自负，不否认，不虚假。当你学会学习时，你就会认识到学习的机制。这将赋予你待人接物的智慧和同情。你不能从理想主义出发去教导别人，因为这样你就把自己的期望强加给了他们。你对他们的要求是生命所不能提供的。但是，你所传授给他人的经验和内识是可靠的，他们能够接受并以自己的方式加以使用。这样，你就不会对他们的学习提出任何个人要求，而是让你内在的内识给予他们内在的内识。这样，你也就成为了教学和学习的见证人。</p><p>Therefore, today bear witness to your own learning and learn to learn. Upon the hour, remind yourself that you are learning to learn. In your two meditation practices, allow yourself to enter stillness and peace. Observe yourself as you move forward and as you hold yourself back. Exert your will on your own behalf compassionately and firmly, and judge not your advancement because you are not in a position to judge, because you are learning to learn.</p><p>因此，今天要见证自己的学习，学会学习。每时每刻，都要提醒自己，你正在学会学习。在两次冥想练习中，让自己进入静止与平和。观察自己的前进和退缩。同情而坚定地代表自己行使意志，不要评判自己的进步，因为你没有资格评判，因为你正在学习。</p><p>Practice 150: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You acknowledge your Ancient Home and your Ancient Destiny. You acknowledge those who sent you and those who will receive you when you leave this world.

What you affirm within yourself you affirm for all individuals, in all circumstances, in all worlds and in all dimensions. Thus, you affirm the reality of Knowledge. Thus, you affirm your Ancient Home while you are here.</p><p>因此，你的练习是给世界的礼物，因为它给予了你内心所肯定的内识。你对自己的肯定，就是对所有个体、所有环境、所有世界和所有维度的肯定。因此，你肯定了内识的真实性。因此，当你在这里时，你就肯定了你的古老家园。</p><p>Upon the hour, give to the world through your practice of giving. Remind yourself of this. In your two longer practice periods, give yourself completely into stillness and silence. Give of your heart and give of your mind. Give all that you realize you can give, for this is a gift to the world. Though you cannot as yet see the result, have confidence that this giving will extend beyond your own mind and will touch all minds in the universe, for all minds are truly joined in reality.</p><p>每个小时，通过你给予的练习来回馈世界。提醒自己这一点。在你的两个较长的练习期间，完全投入到宁静与静默中。用你的心去给予，用你的心灵去给予。给予你认识到的所有你能给予的内识，因为这是给世界的礼物。虽然你还无法看到结果，但要有信心，这种给予会超越你自己的心灵并触及宇宙中所有的心灵，因为所有的心灵在现实中是真正连接在一起的。</p><p>Practice 149: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You personally are a servant, but you are in relationship with the Master, and so your union is complete. Thus, all aspects of yourself find their rightful place. All things are brought into alignment and harmony with one purpose and one goal. Your life is simple because it is in harmony and in balance. Knowledge will indicate all things that must be done for you—physically, emotionally and mentally—to develop this balance and to maintain it in your current circumstances.

Review the past six days of practice and gauge your understanding of your progress appropriately. Allow yourself to be a beginning student of Knowledge so that you may receive the very most. You will proceed on from here with greater certainty and speed and greater involvement as well as you learn to utilize all things for your benefit.</p><p>祝贺你迄今为止所取得的成就。回顾过去六天的练习，适当衡量自己对进步的理解。让自己成为内识的初学者，这样你才能获得最大的收获。当你学会善用万事万物为自己谋福利时，你将会更有把握、更快、更投入地继续前进。</p><p>Practice 140: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 140 ：一段漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

To not participate and to attempt to understand is utterly fruitless, utterly frustrating and without a happy or satisfying result of any kind. We are preparing you to participate in life, not to judge it, for life will hold a greater promise than your judgments could ever reveal. Your understanding is born of participation and is the result of participation. Thus, learn to participate and then to understand, for this is the true sequence of things.</p><p>如果你回想自己曾通过简单地遵循预备步骤而学到的许多事，这个事实是如此显而易见。不参与其中而试图理解是完全没有结果的，完全令人沮丧的，而且不会带来任何快乐或满足的结果。我们正在准备你参与生命，而不是去评判它，因为生命中蕴藏的希望远比你的评判所能揭示的要大得多。你的理解是通过参与产生的，是参与的结果。因此，学会参与，然后再理解，因为这是学习的真实顺序。</p><p>This day remember your hourly practices and allow your two meditations in stillness to become deeper. Allow no thoughts of fear, anxiety or self-doubt to dissuade you from your greater activity. Your ability to practice regardless of your emotional state demonstrates that the presence of Knowledge is within you, for Knowledge is beyond all emotional states and is unfettered by them. If you wish to see the stars, you must look beyond the clouds. What are your fears but clouds that pass through your mind? They only change the character of the surface of your mind, but the depth of your mind remains unchanged forever.</p><p>今天，记住每小时的练习，并让你在静心中进行的两次冥想变得更加深入。不要让任何恐惧、焦虑或自我怀疑的念头阻碍你进行更伟大的活动。无论你的情绪状态如何，能够坚持练习就证明了内识的存在，因为内识超越了所有情绪状态，不受其束缚。如果你想看到星星，你必须越过云层。你的恐惧不过是你心中飘过的云彩。它们只会改变你心灵表面的特征，但你心灵的深度永远不会改变。</p><p>Practice 138: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 138 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

Your origin, your purpose here and your destination when you leave are very  mysterious. They can only be experienced to be comprehended. How can you, at this given moment, understand the mystery of your life? You would have to be at the end of your life to understand what has transpired thus far, and you are not at the end of your life in the world. You would have to see the world from your Ancient Home to understand the true meaning of the world. You are in the world now, so you must be present to the world. Yet this mystery can be experienced and must be experienced. You cannot understand it at this moment, but in this moment you can experience it fully. Within this experience, it will yield to you all of the things that you now need to take the vital step that is waiting for you to take.</p><p>你的生命是一个谜团。你的起源、你在这里的目的以及你离开时的去向都非常神秘。只有通过体验才能理解这些谜团。在此刻，你怎么能理解你生命的神秘呢？你必须在生命结束时才能理解迄今为止发生的事情，而你现在还没有走到生命的尽头。你必须从你古老的家园来看世界，才能理解世界的真正意义。而你现在身处世界之中，因此你必须对世界保持警觉。然而，这种神秘是可以体验到的，而且必须体验到。在此刻你无法理解它，但在此刻你可以完全地体验它。在这种体验中，它会向你揭示所有你现在需要的准备，以便你能迈出等待你迈出的关键一步。</p><p>Therefore, do not burden your mind with the requirement of understanding, for you will seek the impossible and will only confuse yourself and add to the burden of your thinking. Rather, give yourself to experience the mystery of your life with wonder and appreciation that the world is far greater than what your senses have reported thus far and that your life is far greater than what your judgments have determined.</p><p>因此，不要用理解的要求来给你的心灵增加负担，因为你将追求不可能的事情，只会让你自己困惑，并增加你的思考负担。相反，以惊奇和感激之情去体验你生命的神秘，因为世界远比你到目前为止感知到的要大得多，而你的生命也远比你的判断所决定的要伟大得多。</p><p>Repeat this idea upon the hour and practice your RAHN meditation twice today with great depth and sincerity. Allow your practice today to reaffirm your commitment to Knowledge, for you need only follow the steps as they are given.</p><p>每小时重复这一想法，并且今天进行两次深度和真诚的RAHN冥想练习。让你的练习作为今天重新确认你对内识的承诺，因为你只需按照给出的步骤去做。</p><p>Practice 137: Two 30-minute practice periods.

As you follow this purpose, your calling in life—which is a specific role that you will be asked to take— will naturally emerge step by step. It will not require your definition. It will simply emerge, and you will understand it more deeply and more completely with each step, for each step will fulfill it even more.</p><p>这将回答你关于你目的的问题。当你追随这个目标时，你在人生中的召唤——一个你将被要求扮演的具体角色——将会一步步地自然出现。它不需要你的定义。它将会简单地浮现出来，随着每一步你会更加深刻和全面地理解它，因为每一步都会进一步实现它。</p><p>Your Knowledge is your purpose. Remind yourself of this upon the hour, and be glad that an answer has been given. But the answer is not merely an idea. It is an opportunity for preparation, for all true answers to all genuine questions are some form of preparation. It is the preparation that you require and not answers alone. Your mind is full of answers already, and what have they done but add to the burden of your thinking? Follow, then, the preparation given this day and each day within Our program so that you may receive the answer to your question. Your purpose is to reclaim your Knowledge, and that is what We will undertake today.</p><p>你的内识就是你的目的。每小时提醒自己这一点，并为这个答案的给出而感到高兴。但这个答案不仅仅是一个想法。它是一个准备的机会，因为所有对所有真正问题的真实答案都是某种形式的准备。你需要的是准备，而不仅仅是答案。你的心灵已经充满了答案，而这些答案除了增加你的思考负担之外，还有什么作用呢？那么，跟随今天和每一天我们在此计划中给出的准备，这样你就可以获得问题的答案。你的目标是重新获得你的内识，这就是我们今天要进行的工作。</p><p>Again, remind yourself of your affirmation upon the hour. Give it thought throughout the day so that it may be the sole focus of your understanding today. In your two longer meditation practices, continue to repeat the word RAHN, which will stimulate Ancient Knowledge within you. You do not need to understand the potency of this practice to receive its full benefit. To receive its full benefit, you need only practice it as it is given.</p><p>再次，每小时提醒自己这一确认。整天思考它，让它成为你今天理解的唯一焦点。在你的两个较长的冥想练习中，继续重复“RAHN”这个词，它将激发你内在的古老内识。你不需要理解这个练习的力量，就能获得其全部益处。为了获得其全部益处，你只需按照所给的练习进行。</p><p>Practice 136: Two 30-minute practice periods.

You need only take a step in its direction  to feel the growing presence of Knowledge in your life. The closer you are to Knowledge, the more you will experience it. The more that you experience it, the closer you will want to become because this is a natural attraction. This is true love, the attraction of like to like. This is what gives the universe all of its meaning. This is what joins life together completely. Be free this day of definitions, and allow your mind to take its natural formation. Allow your heart to follow its natural course. Allow Knowledge to express itself through your mind, whose outward structure is now becoming open and free.</p><p>就像你的目的一样，你的天命超越了你的定义。你只需朝它的方向迈出一步，就能感受到内识在你生命中的日益增长的存在。你越接近内识，你就会越多地体验到它。你体验得越多，就越想更接近它，因为这是一种自然的吸引力。这是真实的爱，同类相吸的吸引力。这就是赋予宇宙所有意义的内识。这就是让生命完全结合在一起的内识。今天摆脱定义的束缚，容许你的心灵采取它的自然形式。让你的心跟随其自然的轨迹。让内识通过你的心灵表达出来，它的外在结构现在变得开放和自由。</p><p>Remind yourself of your practice upon the hour. In your two deep meditations today, continue with your RAHN practice, speaking the word RAHN on each exhale. Allow yourself to feel the presence of your own life, the presence of your Teachers and the depth of your own Knowledge. Allow your self-discipline to be exerted meaningfully today, to engage your mind in this way. For as the mind is brought into proximity of its true destination, it will respond accordingly and everything will follow its natural course. Then you will feel that Grace is with you.</p><p>每小时提醒自己练习。在你今天的两次深度冥想中，继续进行RAHN练习，在每次呼气时念出RAHN这个词。让自己感受到自己的生命存在，感受到你的老师们的存在和你内心内识的深度。今天有意义地运用你的自律，以这种方式让你的心灵参与进来。因为当心灵接近其真正的目标时，它会相应地做出反应，一切都会按照自然的轨迹进行。然后你会感受到恩典与自己同在。</p><p>Practice 135: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Do not live by definitions. Live by experience and understanding. You do not need to define your purpose, and if you attempt to do so, always remember that it is only a temporary expedient. Do not give it great credibility. In this way, the world cannot anger you, for what can the world do to you but undermine your definition of yourself? If you are not living upon your definitions, the world cannot harm you, for it cannot touch the place of Knowledge that is within you. Only Knowledge can touch Knowledge. Only Knowledge in another can touch Knowledge within you. Only Knowledge within you can touch Knowledge in another.</p><p>你不需要定义自己的目的，因为随着时间的推移，你的目的将自然地浮现并为你所知。不要依靠定义来生活，而是通过经验和理解来生活。你不需要定义你的目的，如果你尝试这么做，始终记住这只是一种临时的权宜之计。不要赋予它太多的可信度。这样，世界就无法激怒你，因为世界能对你做什么，除了破坏你对自己的定义？如果你不依靠定义来生活，世界就无法伤害你，因为它无法触及你内在的内识之地。只有内识能触及内识。只有另一个人中的内识能触及你内在的内识。只有你内在的内识能触及另一个人中的内识。</p><p>Therefore, do not define your purpose today. Be without definitions so that the experience of purpose may grow. And as it grows, it will give you the content of your purpose, without distortion or deception.

Let this be your total focus. This word will serve to stimulate Ancient Knowledge within you and give you the strength that you most need at this time.</p><p>每小时提醒自己不要定义目的，并开始思考在你过去的经历中这样做的代价。在你的两个冥想练习中，让自己静下来。在每次呼气时，说出“RAHN”这个词。RAHN。RAHN。你只需在冥想中每次呼气时说出“RAHN”这个词。让这成为你全部的焦点。这个词将有助于激发你内在的古老内识，并在这个时候给予你最需要的力量。</p><p>Practice 134: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Review this objectively without condemnation, once again realizing your advancements and your limitations and strengthening your resolve. For it is your desire for Knowledge that We wish to cultivate as well as your capacity. It is right thinking, right action and true motivation that will advance you naturally in the direction in which you are meant to go. Each step forward will give you a greater sense of purpose, meaning and direction in life and will free you from attempting to resolve matters that do not require resolution and from attempting to understand things out of fear and anxiety. The more at peace you are with your nature, the more your nature can express the greatness that you have brought with you. Thus, you will become a light unto all around you, and you will marvel at the events of your own life, which in itself will be a miracle.</p><p>今天我们将回顾过去一周的准备工作。客观地回顾这一点，不加谴责，再次认识到你的进步和局限性，并坚定你的决心。因为我们希望培养你对内识的渴望以及你的能力。正确的思考、正确的行动和真正的动力会自然地推动你朝着你想要去的方向前进。每向前迈出一步都会让你有一种更大的人生目标、意义和方向感，让你摆脱试图解决不需要解决的问题，也摆脱试图出于恐惧和焦虑而理解事物。你越是与你的自然性和平相处，你的自然就越能表达你所带来的伟大。因此，你将成为你周围所有人的光，你将对你自己生命中的事件感到惊讶，它本身就是一个奇迹。</p><p>In your long practice period today, undertake your review with depth and sincerity.

This is not to solidify your separation or to make it more complete, but instead to enable you to join meaningfully in relationship. Let this be a tacit understanding: You can do nothing in the world without relationship. You can accomplish nothing; you can advance in no direction; you can realize no truth; you can contribute nothing of value without relationship. So as your independence from the past grows, thus does your promise for inclusion in the present and the future grow as well. For freedom is meant to empower you to join.</p><p>摆脱过去——过去的判断、过去的联系、过去的痛苦、过去的伤害和过去的困难——使你在当下获得独立。这并不是为了巩固你的分离或使其更加完整，而是为了让你能够有意义地加入到关系中。让这成为一个默契的理解：在没有关系的情况下，你在世界上无法做任何事情。你无法完成任何事情；你无法朝任何方向前进；你无法认识任何真理；你无法贡献任何有价值的礼物。因此，随着你从过去中获得的独立性增长，你在当下和未来的包容性也随之增长。因为自由的目的是让你能够加入。</p><p>Remember this idea upon the hour and give it consideration in light of all of your experiences today.

This provides the foundation for all meaningful relationships. Do not seek relationships outside of this context, for they will lack foundation and, though perhaps very alluring, will prove to be very difficult for you. Whether you are seeking marriage, great friendship or someone to help you in your work, remember that Knowledge will draw to you all individuals as you truly need them.</p><p>寻求真实目的的经验。这为所有有意义的关系提供了基础。在这个背景之外不要寻找关系，因为它们将缺乏基础，尽管可能非常吸引人，但对你来说可能会非常困难。无论你是在寻找婚姻、伟大的友谊还是有人帮助你完成工作，请记住，内识会将你真正需要的人带到你身边。</p><p>Therefore, today concentrate on purpose and not on relationship. The greater your experience of purpose, the greater your comprehension of relationship. Though you will see that people come together for enjoyment and stimulation, there is a far greater component in their meeting. Few people recognize this, but it is given you to recognize this through practice and experience. You can be certain that if you are not trying to fit people into your own idea of purpose, you will be opening yourself to the genuine experience of purpose itself. As you begin to observe yourself objectively, you will begin to see the manifestations of your own will in contrast to Knowledge, and this will be very essential for your learning.</p><p>因此，今天集中精力于目的而非关系。你对目的的体验越深，你对关系的理解就越深。虽然你会看到人们为了享乐和刺激而聚在一起，但他们的相遇中有一个更大的组成部分。很少有人认识到这一点，但通过练习和体验，你会被赋予认识到这一点的机会。你可以确信，如果你不是试图将人们纳入你自己对目的的理解中，你就会开放自己去体验真正的目的。当你开始客观地观察自己时，你将开始看到自己的意志与内识之间的对比，这对于你的学习将非常重要。</p><p>Today remind yourself upon the hour of your intent to realize your purpose. Let today be a step in that direction—a step that will save you years and years of time, a step that will advance you forever towards your goal of Knowledge, for Knowledge is drawing you. In your two deeper practice periods, allow Knowledge to draw you.

As you have relationships with one another on a personal level, you also have relationships on the level of Knowledge.

You need only give yourself to your preparation and have confidence that people will come to you when you need them. This will require that you assess your needs in contrast to your wishes. If your wishes do not represent your genuine needs, then you will confuse your life terribly. You will place a burden upon yourself and upon those with whom you are engaged that can only oppress them, and you as well. Without this oppression, people will be free to come to you as you truly need them.</p><p>你无需刻意寻求关系。你只需要全身心地投入到准备工作中，并相信在你需要他们时，人们会自然而然地来到你身边。这将要求你评估清楚自己的需求和愿望之间的差异。如果你的愿望并不代表你真正的需求，那你的生活就会非常混乱。你会给自己和与你交往的人带来负担，这种负担只会压迫他们，也会压迫你自己。没有了这种压迫，人们就可以自由地来找你，因为你真正需要他们。</p><p>Remind yourself of this upon the hour today, and in your two longer practice periods allow your mind to enter receptivity.

I will be with them."></a>Step 129  My Teachers are with me. I will be with them.</h2><p>Your Teachers are with you. They are not speaking to you except on very rare occasions, and then only  if you are capable of hearing. From time to time they will send their thoughts into your mind, and you will experience this as your own spark of inspiration. You are as yet unaware of how your mind is joined with all other minds, but in time you will begin to experience this in the context of your own world. The demonstration of this will become so obvious that you will wonder how you could ever have doubted it.</p><p>你的老师与你同在。他们不会对你说话，除非在极少数情况下，而且只有在你能够听到的情况下。他们会时不时地把他们的感想传递到你的心灵中，你会体验到这是你自己的灵感火花。你还没有察觉到你的心灵是如何与所有其他心灵结合在一起的，但随着时间的推移，你将开始在自己的世界中体验到这一点。这一点会变得如此明显，以至于你会怀疑自己怎么会对此产生怀疑。</p><p>Your Teachers are with you and today in your two longer practice periods, practice being with them. You do not need to create an image of them in order to have this experience. You do not need to hear a voice or see a face, for their presence is enough to give you a complete experience that you are in fact together. If you will be still, breathe deeply and not weave fantasies—neither happy fantasies nor fearful fantasies—you will begin to experience what is actually there. Your Teachers are actually there. And today you can practice being with them.</p><p>你的老师与你同在，今天在你两个较长的练习时间里，练习与他们在一起。你不需要为他们创造一个形象来获得这种体验。你不需要听到他们的声音，也不需要看到他们的面孔，因为他们的存在就足以让你完整地体验到你们其实是在一起的。如果你能静下心来，深呼吸，不编织幻想——无论是快乐的幻想还是恐惧的幻想——你就会开始体验到什么是真正的存在。你的老师就在这里。今天，你可以练习与他们在一起。</p><p>Practice 129: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 129： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Step-128-My-Teachers-are-with-me-I-need-not-fear"><a href="#Step-128-My-Teachers-are-with-me-I-need-not-fear" class="headerlink" title="Step 128  My Teachers are with me. I need not fear."></a>Step 128  My Teachers are with me. I need not fear.</h2><p>Your Inner Teachers are with you, and you need not fear. If you have sufficient confidence  in Knowledge, based upon actual experience, and sufficient confidence in the presence of your Teachers, based upon actual experience, this will give you a certainty and a faith in life that will counteract all fear that is unnecessary. This will leave your mind at ease.</p><p>你的内在老师与你同在，你无需恐惧。如果你基于实际经验，对内识有足够的信心，基于实际经验，对你老师的存在有足够的信心，这将给你带来一种确定性和对生命的信心，从而抵消一切不必要的恐惧。这会让你心安理得。</p><p>Only concern that your Knowledge is being violated will emanate from Knowledge, and then only to indicate that you need to reassess your actions and ideas. Knowledge has a self-correcting principle. That is why it is your Inner Guidance. If you are going against your Knowledge, you will be ill at ease with yourself, and this will give rise to anxiety. Much of the fear that you experience moment to moment is simply a matter of your own creation, your own negative imagination. But, then, there is fear that is born of the violation of Knowledge. This is more a discomfort than a fear, for it rarely carries with it any kind of imagery at all, though ideas can come into your mind as a form of warning should you be attempting a behavior or a line of thinking that is dangerous or destructive.</p><p>只有当你的内识受到侵犯时，内识才会发出担忧，然后才会表明你需要重新评估自己的行为和观念。内识具有自我纠正原则。这就是为什么它是你的内在指引。如果你违背了内识，你就会对自己感到不自在，从而产生焦虑。你每时每刻都在经历的恐惧，很多都是你自己制造出来的，是你自己的负面想象。但是，也有一些恐惧源于对内识的侵犯。这种恐惧与其说是恐惧，不如说是一种不适，因为它很少带有任何形式的意象，尽管如果你试图采取危险或破坏性的行为或思维方式，想法可能会作为一种警告形式进入你的心灵。</p><p>Fear that is born of negative imagination comprises the vast majority of the fear with which you entertain yourself. This you must learn to counteract, for it is an inappropriate use of your mind. Here you create an experience for yourself, experience it and then call it reality. Meanwhile, you have not been present with life at all. You have merely been in fantasy within yourself. Negative imagination drains you emotionally, physically and mentally. It can be escalated to such heights that it can dominate your thinking altogether. For how else can you be separate in the universe except in your own thoughts? You cannot actually be separate from God. You cannot actually be separate from Knowledge. You can only hide in your own thoughts and weave them together to create a separate identity and experience for yourself which, though quite demonstrative, are in fact completely an illusion.</p><p>由消极想象产生的恐惧占你自娱自乐的恐惧的绝大部分。你必须学会抵制这种恐惧，因为这是对心灵的不当使用。在这里，你为自己创造一种经历，体验它，然后称之为现实。与此同时，你根本没有与生命同在。你只是沉浸在自己的幻想中。消极的想象会消耗你的情感、身体和心理。它可以升级到如此高度，以至于完全主宰你的思维方式。因为除了在你自己的感想中，你还能在宇宙中分离吗？你实际上无法与上帝分离。你实际上无法与内识分离。你只能隐藏在你自己的感想中，并将它们编织在一起，为自己创造一种独立的身份和体验，虽然这很有说服力，但实际上完全是一种幻觉。</p><p>In your two meditation practices today, once again enter into stillness. Today there will be no mental speculation or activity, for the mind will once again come to rest so that it may experience its reality. Let not fear or anxiety dissuade you. Remember, this is your negative imagination only. Only Knowledge can indicate if you are doing something inappropriate, and that will only be in the face of immediate events. You will find that this is quite different from negative imagination and will require a different response from you.</p><p>在今天的两次冥想练习中，请再次进入静止状态。今天将不会有任何心理猜测或活动，因为心灵将再次得到休息，从而体验到它自己的真实。不要因为恐惧或焦虑而放弃。记住，这只是你的消极想象。只有内识才能指出你是否做了不恰当的事情，而这只会在面对眼前的事件时才会出现。你会发现这与消极想象截然不同，需要你做出不同的反应。</p><p>Practice 128: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 128： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Do not try to get even with God by making the world destitute, for God created a world of beauty and opportunity. Do not try to get even with God by refusing to love or accept yourself, for God still knows you as you are. Do not try to get even with God today by ruining your relationships for your own selfish purposes, for God understands your relationships as they truly exist and understands their greater promise as well. You cannot get even with God. You can only harm yourself.</p><p>不要试图通过做一个悲惨的人来报复上帝，因为上帝只知道你是创造的一部分。不要试图通过让世界变得一无所有来报复上帝，因为上帝创造了一个充满美丽和机遇的世界。不要试图通过拒绝爱自己或不接受自己来报复上帝，因为上帝仍然知道你的本来样子。今天，不要为了一己私欲而破坏关系，以此来报复上帝，因为上帝理解你的关系的真实存在，也理解它们更大的承诺。你无法报复上帝。你只能伤害自己。</p><p>Therefore, accept that you have lost the battle against God. In your defeat is your greatest victory, for God has never lost you, though you have lost God temporarily in your imagination. Your love for God is so profound that you are as yet afraid of it, for it represents the greatest power within you that you can possibly possess. You must learn of this through direct experience. Therefore, do not try to get even with God today by reinforcing an idea about yourself based solely upon error and assumption, for Knowledge is with you. You are the happy victor in your own defeat.</p><p>因此，接受你在与上帝的战斗中失败的事实吧。你的失败是你最大的胜利，因为上帝从未失去你，尽管你在想象中暂时失去了上帝。你对上帝的爱是如此深沉，以至于你至今都害怕上帝，因为它代表着你内心可能拥有的最大力量。你必须通过直接体验来知道这一点。因此，今天不要试图通过强化对自己的想法来报复上帝，因为内识与你同在。你是自己失败后的胜利者。</p><p>In your two practice periods today, repeat this idea and then attempt to think about it. Our practices today will be engaging the mind in exploration and analysis. This is a useful application of your mind. Think about this message and all of your ideas surrounding it, and you will begin to understand your own current belief system. You will be able to understand this objectively. Then you will be able to work with it, for the mind is fixed in a certain structure until it is utilized for other purposes. Do not accept this structure as your reality, for the outward manifestation of your mind is a structure that you have imposed upon it. Yet its real inward harmony and nature seek only to be expressed. To enable this to happen you must have an adequate structure in the mind to enable the mind to express itself in the physical world without restraint or distortion. It is towards this, then, that We will work today.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，请重复这个想法，然后尝试思考。我们今天的练习将让心灵参与探索和分析。这是对心灵的有益运用。思考这个讯息以及围绕它的所有想法，你就会开始理解自己当前的信仰体系。你将能够客观地理解这一点。然后，你就能善用它，因为心灵在被用于其他目的之前，是固定在某种结构中的。不要把这种结构当作你的现实，因为你心灵的外在表现是你强加给它的结构。然而，它真正的内在和谐和自然只寻求表达。要做到这一点，你必须在心灵中建立适当的结构，使心灵能够在物理世界中不受束缚、不受扭曲地表达它自己。因此，我们今天要努力实现这一点。</p><p>Practice 127: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 127 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It will emphasize once again that you are learning to learn. You are learning to understand how you learn. You are learning to understand your strengths and your weaknesses. You are learning to understand your predispositions—those qualities in yourself that you must cultivate and those qualities which you must arrest and bring under conscious control. You are learning to be observant of yourself. Thus, you are learning at last to be objective with yourself. This objectivity is especially important, for it allows you to utilize that which is there to serve you without your condemnation. In this way, your service to yourself becomes immediate and effective.</p><p>今天的复习将集中于过去一周的训练。它将再次强调，你正在学会学习。你正在学习理解自己是如何学习的。你正在学习理解自己的长处和短处。你正在学习理解自己的倾向性——你必须培养自己的这些品质，以及你必须抑制和有意识控制自己的这些品质。你要学会观察自己。因此，你终于学会了客观地对待你自己。这种客观性尤为重要，因为它能让你在不受到谴责的情况下善用那些为你服务的品质。这样，你对自己的服务就会变得直接而有效。</p><p>If you can learn to be objective with yourself, you can learn to be objective with the world. This will allow Knowledge to shine through you, for you will not be attempting to make the world into what you wish it to be, and you will not be attempting to make yourself into what you wish yourself to be. This is the beginning of true resolution and true happiness, but even greater than this, it is the beginning of genuine contribution.</p><p>如果你能学会客观地对待自己，你就能学会客观地对待世界。这将让内识在你身上大放异彩，因为你不会试图把世界变成你希望的样子，也不会试图把自己变成你希望的样子。这是真实的决心和真实幸福的开始，但比这更重要的是，这是真正贡献的开始。</p><p>In your one long practice period today review the past week, keeping these things in mind. Strengthen your experience of Knowledge today by supporting its outward manifestations and doubt not the power of this preparation to bring you to Knowledge itself.</p><p>在今天的一次长时间练习中，回顾过去一周，牢记这些练习。通过支持内识的外在表现，加强你今天对内识的体验，不要怀疑这种准备将你带入内识它本身的力量。</p><p>Practice 126: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 126 ：一段长时间的实践</p>]]></content>

It is better to be the person you already  are. The person you already are is the power of Knowledge carried in the vehicle of the nature of an individual. This is already established, and it is under development right now. Why try to be something today when you are something already? Why not be what you are? Find out what you are. This takes great courage, for you must risk disappointing your own idealistic view of yourself and the world. This takes encouragement because you must risk giving up your selfhatred, which is a way that you separate yourself from life.</p><p>你已经是某个人，为什么还要试图成为另一个人呢？成为你已经是的这个人更好。你已经是的这个人，是以个人的自然性为载体的内识力量。这一点已经确立，现在正在发展之中。为什么今天还要尝试成为某个人呢？为什么不成为你本来的样子呢？找出你是谁。这需要极大的勇气，因为你必须冒着失望于自己理想化的自我形象以及你所希望世界的风险。这需要鼓励，因为你必须冒着放弃自我厌恶的风险，而自我厌恶是你与生命分离的一种方式。</p><p>Therefore, this day be exactly as you are. Remind yourself upon the hour. And in your two meditation practices today, allow yourself to be still and to receive, for you are not trying to be someone today.</p><p>因此，今天就要像你本来的样子一样。每小时提醒自己一次。在你今天的两次冥想实践中，让自己静下来接收自己，因为你今天不需要试图成为某人。</p><p>Practice 125: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Today be yourself, but be self-observant, keeping in mind that Knowledge is with you as you vacillate to and from, towards and away from Knowledge itself. Because Knowledge does not vacillate, it is a source of certainty, consistency and stability for you. Because it is unafraid of the world, it is a source of fearlessness for you. You are not pitiful, so you need not pretend.</p><p>你不需要假装自己很快乐，因为这只会掩盖你的自怜，加剧你的困惑，加深你的困境。今天，你要做你自己，但要自我观察，牢记当你摇摆不定地走向或远离内识时，内识与你同在。因为内识不会摇摆不定，所以它是你确定性、一致性和稳定性的来源。因为它不惧怕世界，所以它是你无畏的来源。你并不可怜，所以无需伪装。</p><p>Do not pretend to be happy today, for he or she who is truly satisfied may cast any expression upon the world, but within their expression will be the power of Knowledge. This is what is most important. Knowledge is not a form of behavior. It is an intense experience of life. Therefore, do not attempt to persuade yourself or others with a demonstration of behavior, for this is unnecessary.</p><p>今天，不要假装快乐，因为真实满足的人可以向世界投射任何表情，但在他们的表情中将蕴含着内识的力量。这才是最重要的。内识不是一种行为方式。它是一种强烈的生命体验。因此，不要试图用行为表现来说服自己或他人，因为这是没有必要的。</p><p>Repeat this statement upon the hour and feel its power and its gift of freedom. Allow yourself to be exactly as you are today. In your two deep meditation practices, allow yourself to enter stillness, for when you are not trying to be someone, you may have the luxury of stillness, which is the luxury of love.</p><p>每时每刻重复这句话，感受它的力量和自由的礼物。允许自己做今天的自己。在你的两次深度冥想练习中，允许自己进入静止状态，因为当你不试图成为某个人时，你可以奢侈地享受静止，这是爱的奢侈。</p><p>Practice 124: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Pity must only reassert an old idea of yourself, which is bereft of truth, bereft of hope and bereft of any meaningful foundation. Do not pity yourself today, for you are not pitiful. If this day is sad or confused, it is only because you have lost contact with Knowledge, which you may practice today to regain.</p><p>当内识与你同在时，你怎么能可怜自己呢？自怜只能让你重新认识自己的旧观念，而这种观念是没有真理、没有希望、没有任何意义的。今天，不要可怜自己，因为你并不可怜。如果你今天感到悲伤或困惑，那只是因为你失去了与内识的连接，而你今天可以通过练习来重新获得内识。</p><p>As you practice today, be aware of the many subtle forms of self-pity that you entertain. Be aware of the many subtle forms of manipulation of others as you attempt to make them like or accept you according to a view of yourself that you are attempting to claim. When you are with Knowledge, you do not need to proclaim yourself; you do not need to show yourself; you do not need to control others to like or accept you, for Knowledge is with you.</p><p>在今天的练习过程中，要注意自己许多微妙的自怜形式。注意你操纵他人的许多微妙形式，因为你试图按照自己的观点让他人喜欢或接受你。当你与内识同在时，你不需要宣扬自己；你不需要展示自己；你不需要控制他人来喜欢或接受你，因为内识与你同在。</p><p>Therefore, do not pity yourself, for you are not pitiful. Today be a beginning student of Knowledge, for that is anything but pitiful. A greater vantage point you cannot imagine.</p><p>因此，不要可怜自己，因为你并不可怜。今天，做一名内识的初学者吧，因为这并不可怜。你无法想象更高的境界。</p><p>Upon the hour, then, repeat this idea. Allow it to enter your mind and consider it for a moment. In your two practice periods, repeat this affirmation and then enter into stillness. No being who is pitiful can enter into silence, for silence is the experience of profound relationship, and stillness is the acceptance of profound love. Who can be pitiful under such circumstances?</p><p>因此，在这个时刻，重复这个想法。让它进入你的心灵，并思考片刻。在你的两次练习中，重复这句话，然后进入静止状态。没有一个可怜的人可以进入静止，因为静止是对深刻关系的体验，静止是对深刻爱的接纳。在这种情况下，谁还会可怜呢？</p><p>Practice 123: Two 30-minute practice periods.

This is an active form of prayer. Think not that the power of it is not received by those whom you have concentrated upon. Remember today not to try to determine the outcome of their dilemma or their need, but only encourage and empower them to carry forth with their own abilities. You wish to stimulate Knowledge within them as Knowledge is now being stimulated within you. This giving, then, will not have an expectation of a return, for you are giving that which enables others to be strong in their lives. You are not in a position to judge the outcome, for the outcome of your giving will not be revealed until later when the gift has been accepted and has found its place in the receiver. Therefore, give freely without expectation and give in order to experience the power of your gift this day.</p><p>今天，在你的两次练习中，请继续给予他人。这是一种积极的祷告形式。不要以为你所专注的人没有收到你的力量。记住，今天不要试图决定他们困境的结果或他们的需要，而只是鼓励他们，赋予他们力量，让他们用自己的能力去实现。你希望激发他们内心的内识，就像现在你内心的内识一样。因此，这种给予并不期待回报，因为你的给予能让他人在生命中变得强大。你没有资格评判结果，因为你给予的结果要等到礼物被接受并在接收者身上找到位置之后才会显现。因此，自由给予，不抱期望，给予是为了在这一天体验你的礼物的力量。</p><p>Practice 122: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 122 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Send that individual that quality. Send them love or strength or faith or encouragement or determination or surrender or acceptance or self-discipline—whatever they need to bring about resolution in their lives. You are free to give this today, for your own needs are being met.</p><p>今天你将有两次特别的练习，你要想到一个需要帮助的人，然后给他一种你自己也希望得到的品质。把这种品质送给这个人。向他传递爱、力量、信念、鼓励、决心、屈服、接纳或自律——任何他需要的品质，以解决他生命中的问题。今天，你可以自由地传递这些，因为你自己的需求正在得到满足。</p><p>Therefore, in each of your two practices, with your eyes closed, bring to mind individuals and give to them what you know they need. Do not try to solve their problems for them. Do not try to strengthen a preferred outcome, for you cannot usually know the right outcome for any other person. But you can always give strength of character and strengthen their faculties of mind. This will give you your own sense of purpose and will reassert these qualities within yourself, for you must possess them to give them, and in giving them you realize that they are in your possession already.</p><p>因此，在你的两次练习中，闭上眼睛，想起一些人，并给予他们你知道他们需要的品质。不要试图替他们解决问题。不要试图强化他们所希望的结果，因为你通常无法知道其他人的正确结果。但你总能给予他们性格的力量，增强他们的心灵。这将给你自己带来目标感，并在你的内心深处重申这些品质，因为你必须拥有它们才能给予它们，而在给予它们的过程中，你会认识到它们已经在你的心中。</p><p>As you practice today, have no doubt that what you exert for others will be received by them on their own behalf.</p><p>在今天的练习中，你要坚信，你为他人付出的一切，他们也会以自己的名义接收它。</p><p>Practice 121: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 121 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Remember that it abides with you regardless of where you go or what you are doing. Remember that it is given to you to serve you, to nurture you and to elevate you as well. Remember that you need not be aggravated with the world because you can accept the world as it is. Remember that you accept the world as it is so that you will be able to give to it, for the world is developing as you are. Remember that Knowledge is with you, and you need only be with Knowledge to realize its full impact.</p><p>今天记得你的内识。记得它与你同在，无论你走到哪里或在做什么。记得它被赋予你，来服务你，滋养你，并提升你。记得你不必对世界感到懊恼，因为你能接受世界的本来面貌。记得你接受世界的本来面貌是为了能够给予世界，因为世界的发展如同你的成长一般。记得内识与你同在，你只需与内识同在，才能体会其全部影响。</p><p>Remind yourself upon the hour today that Knowledge is with you and give this a moment of thought. Do not let raging emotions or deep depression cast a shadow upon your practice, for your practice is greater than your emotional states, which change like the winds and the clouds but cannot mask the universe above them.</p><p>在今天的每个小时提醒自己，内识与你同在，并且给予这个想法片刻的思考。不要让狂怒的情绪或深深的抑郁蒙蔽你的实践，因为你的实践远超过你那像风云变幻般的情绪状态，而不能掩盖宇宙之上的真实。</p><p>Therefore, realize the littleness of your emotional states and the greatness of Knowledge. In this way, Knowledge will balance your emotional states and will reveal to you the source of your own emotions, which is the source of your expression in the world. This is the mystery of life which you are now learning to explore.</p><p>因此，意识到你情绪状态的渺小，以及内识的伟大。通过这种方式，内识将平衡你的情感状态，并向你揭示你情感的源头，这也是你正在探索的生命奥秘。</p><p>Practice 120: Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 120 ：每小时练习</p>]]></content>

Try to remember how seriously you thought about each day’s practice and how well you utilized that practice. Do not think you can complain rightfully about this preparation unless you are utilizing it to its fullest extent. Your role here is only to follow the steps as they are given and not to alter them according to your preferences. In this way, you place yourself in a position to receive, which is the position you now need to acquire for yourself.</p><p>在这次特别复习中，请回顾过去两周的练习，复习每一条指令，回忆每一天的练习。试着回忆一下你是如何认真思考每一天的练习的，以及你是如何很好地善用这些练习的。除非你充分善用了这些准备，否则不要认为你可以理直气壮地抱怨这些准备。在这里，你的任务只是按照规定的步骤去做，而不是根据自己的喜好去改变。这样，你就能使自己处于接收的位置，这也是你现在需要为自己获得的位置。</p><p>In your two long practice periods today, each one given to one week of practice, review the past two weeks. Try to be very kind with yourself, but recognize if you are falling short of the requirements and do not deceive yourself in this regard. Rededicate yourself to deepening your practice and your resolve, reminding yourself of the simplicity of your life and the true value that is being given to you. In this way, you will learn a new way of living. You will learn how to receive and how to give, and your life will be free of the darkness of complexity. For simplicity must always be of the light; it must always be of the good.</p><p>在今天的两次长时间练习中，每次练习一周，回顾过去两周。试着对自己好一点，但要认识到自己是否达不到要求，不要在这方面欺骗自己。重新致力于深化你的练习和决心，提醒自己生命的简单性和赋予你的真正价值。这样，你将学会一种新的生活方式。你将学会如何接收，如何给予，你的生活将摆脱复杂的黑暗。因为简单必须永远是光明的，必须永远是美好的。</p><p>Therefore, give yourself to this Review so that you may understand how you learn. These Reviews will demonstrate to you your own learning faculties and your own learning predispositions. They will teach you the necessary things that you will need to know in the future when you will be able to help others learn as well.</p><p>因此，请认真对待这次回顾，以便理解自己是如何学习的。这些回顾将向你展示你自己的学习能力和学习倾向。它们将教给你将来帮助他人学习时需要知道的必要知识。</p><p>Practice 119: Two long practice periods.</p><p>练习 119 ：两个长时间的练习时段</p>]]></content>

When you are with Knowledge, you are here to serve the world. The world, then, is not a prison anymore. It is not a continual source of discomfort and disappointment. It provides for you an opportunity to give and an opportunity to re-establish your true understanding. Do not seek refuge in spiritual things, for your purpose is to give to the world. Allow the world to be as it is, and your condemnation of it will not come back to haunt you. For without condemnation, there is only the opportunity to give. This will draw upon your Knowledge, which will give of its own, and you will be the vehicle for its giving.</p><p>当你与内识同在时，就无需回避世界，因为世界无法主宰你。当你与内识同在时，你在这里是为了服务世界。那么，世界不再是一个监狱。它不再是一个持续带来不适和失望的来源。它为你提供了一个给予的机会，一个重新建立真正理解的机会。不要寻求在精神关系中寻求庇护，因为你的目的是为了给予世界。容许世界保持它的本来面貌，你对它的谴责也不会回过头来困扰你。因为没有谴责，只有给予的机会。这将调动你的内识，它将自行给予，而你将成为它给予的载体。</p><p>Think of this now. Allow yourself in your two practice periods to experience the presence of Knowledge in your life. Demand nothing of it. Seek not to question it. Only allow yourself to experience it, for with this all that you seek returns to you naturally without your effort. Utilize your self-discipline only to direct your mind in the proper direction. Once it is so engaged, it will return to Knowledge of its own accord. For that is its destination, that is its love, that is its true companion and that is its true marriage in life.</p><p>现在想一想这一点。在你的两次练习期间，允许你自己体验生命中内识的存在。不要对它有所要求。不要试图质疑它。只是允许自己去经历，因为有了这个，所有你寻求的自然将回到你的身边，无需你的努力。运用你的自我约束力来引导你的心灵朝正确的方向发展。一旦如此，它将自行回归到内识之中。因为这是它的归宿，这是它的爱，这是它真实的伴侣，也是它在生命中的真实结合。</p><p>Practice 118: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 118 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Complexity is a state of self-disassociation which renders you incapable of enjoying life and perceiving your role within it. This is the source of all great poverty, for no worldly accomplishment and no worldly possession can banish the sense of isolation and destitution that accompanies such a disassociation.</p><p>简单使你能够进入生命并在每一刻享受其恩惠。复杂是一种自我分离的状态，使你无法享受生活并意识到自己在其中的角色。这是所有极度贫穷的根源，因为没有世俗的成就和财富可以驱散伴随这种分离的孤立感和贫困感。</p><p>Therefore, today practice stillness more deeply than before so that you may experience the power of Knowledge that is with you. Allow yourself to be simple, for in simplicity all things may be given to you. If you are considering yourself to be complex, or your problems to be complex, it is because you are viewing yourself and your problems without Knowledge and are thus lost in your evaluations. Here you are confusing things of greater value with things of lesser value, things of greater priority with things of lesser priority. Truth must always bring simplicity, for simplicity brings resolution and right understanding and establishes peace and confidence in those who can receive it.</p><p>因此，今天更深入地练习静止，以便你可以经历与你同在的内识的力量。让自己保持简单，因为在简单中一切都可以赋予你。如果你认为自己很复杂，或者你的问题很复杂，那是因为你在没有内识的情况下看待自己和你的问题，因此在评估中迷失了方向。在这里，你混淆了更有价值的关系与较低价值的关系，更重要的关系与次要的关系。真理必须总是带来简单，因为简单带来解决和正确的理解，并能够在接收它的人心中建立和平与信心。</p><p>Practice deeply today. Repeat today’s idea upon the hour, and in your two deep meditation practices, remind yourself that Knowledge is with you and then enter into stillness. Allow yourself to be simple and trust that Knowledge will guide you in all ways.</p><p>今天深入练习。每小时重复今天的想法，在你的两次深度冥想练习中，提醒自己内识与你同在，然后进入静止。让自己保持简单，并相信内识会在所有方面指导你。</p><p>Practice 117: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Knowledge is far more still than you are. It is far more powerful than you are. It is far more certain than you are, and all of its actions are profound and meaningful. There is only a contrast between you and Knowledge because you live in the self that you have made for yourself, and you have temporarily lost your contact with Knowledge. But Knowledge abides with you, for you can never leave it. It will always be there to redeem you, to save you and to reclaim you unto itself, for it is your True Self. Let not beliefs and assumptions masquerade as Knowledge. Allow your mind to become increasingly quiet and still as you undertake the activities of the day.</p><p>要有耐心，这样你才能追随内识。内识比你更加静止。它比你更加强大。它比你更加确定，它的一切行动都是深远而有意义的。你与内识之间的唯一对比是因为你生活在你自己创造的自我之中，你暂时失去了与内识的联系。但内识与你同在，因为你永远无法离开它。它将永远在这里赎回你，拯救你，并重新将你拥入其中，因为它是你真实的自我。不要让信念和假设伪装成内识。让你的心灵在一天的活动中变得越来越宁静和静止。</p><p>Repeat the idea upon the hour and in your two deep meditation practices, allow yourself to enter the stillness and the certainty that Knowledge possesses for you. In this way, your mind will resonate with the Mind of the universe and you will begin to reclaim your ancient abilities and ancient memories. Here the idea of Spiritual Family will begin to have meaning for you, and you will realize that you have come into the world to serve.</p><p>每小时重复这个想法，在你的两次深度冥想实践中，让自己进入内识拥有的静谧和确定性之中。通过这种方式，你的心灵将与宇宙的心灵共鸣，你将开始重新拥有你古老的能力和古老的记忆。在这里，精神家庭的概念将开始对你有意义，你将意识到你来到这个世界是为了服务。</p><p>Practice 116: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It requires your attention. It requires your desire. It requires the relinquishment of things which preoccupy and concern you, things you cannot resolve on your own. Listen to Knowledge today so that it may comfort you and abide with you. In its silence, you will find solid reassurance and confidence as well. For if Knowledge is silent, you need not have anxiety about your life, and if Knowledge speaks, you need only follow so that you may learn the power of Knowledge for you.</p><p>今天倾听内识的力量。它需要你的关注。它需要你的渴望。它需要你放下那些牵扯和担忧你的事物，那些你无法独自解决的工作。今天倾听内识，让它安慰你，并与你同在。在它的沉默中，你将找到坚实的安慰和信心。因为如果内识沉默，你无需为生活感到焦虑；如果内识开口，你只需跟随它，以便你可以学习内识对你的力量。</p><p>You become still because Knowledge is still. You become capable of action because Knowledge is capable of action. You learn to speak with simplicity because Knowledge speaks with simplicity. You learn to be at ease because Knowledge is at ease. You learn to give because Knowledge gives. It is to re-engage you in relationship with your Knowledge that you are now engaged in this program of development.</p><p>你变得安静是因为内识是安静的。你能够行动是因为内识能够行动。你学会简单言语是因为内识言语简单。你学会放松是因为内识是放松的。你学会给予是因为内识的给予。你现在参与这个发展计划，是为了重新与你的内识建立关系。</p><p>Upon the hour today, remind yourself to listen to Knowledge and take a moment to do so in whatever circumstance you find yourself. Your first activity in listening is stillness. Practice this in greater depth in your two meditation practices today, where you practice stillness and receptivity because you wish to listen to Knowledge today.</p><p>在今天的每个整点，提醒自己倾听内识，并在你所处的任何情境中花一点时间这样做。倾听的第一步是安静。今天在你的两次冥想实践中深入练习这一点，你将练习安静和接受，因为你希望今天倾听内识。</p><p>Practice 115: Two 30-minute practice periods.

There is nothing very mysterious about this. It is simply the result of one mind being more concentrated or focused than another. Minds have relative degrees of influence upon one another, depending upon their concentration and depending upon the kind of influence they exert. Let Knowledge persuade you, for that is the greatness that you carry. Let not the opinions or will of others persuade you. Let only their Knowledge influence you, for only this can influence your Knowledge. This will be quite different from feeling dominated, manipulated or persuaded by others.</p><p>任何一个比你更坚定的心灵都可以说服你，对你施加影响。这并不神秘。这只是一个心灵比另一个更集中或更专注的结果。心灵在彼此之间具有相对程度的影响力，这取决于它们的集中程度和它们施加的影响种类。让内识说服你，因为这是你的伟大之处。不要让他人的观点或意愿说服你。只让他们的内识影响你，因为只有他们的内识才能影响你的内识。这与被他人支配、操纵或说服的感觉截然不同。</p><p>Therefore, keep to yourself. Follow Knowledge. If another stimulates your Knowledge, then give that individual your attention so that you may learn of the true powers of persuasion. Yet let not the persuasions of this world—its grievances, its cherished ideals, its morality, its demands or its compromises—influence you, for you are following Knowledge, and you need not follow the persuasions of the world.</p><p>因此，保持自己。跟随内识。如果另一个人激发了你的内识，那么给予那个人你的关注，以便你能够学习到真实的说服力量。但不要让这个世界的说服力量——它的不满、它珍视的理想、它的道德、它的要求或它的妥协——影响你，因为你正在跟随内识，你无需追随世界的说服力量。</p><p>Remind yourself of today’s idea upon the hour and practice stillness deeply in your two meditation practices today.

It is your True Self. Thus, you learn to follow that which is great. Within your limited state, you gain access to that which has no limits. Thus, you become a bridge to Knowledge today.</p><p>今天对你的回顾我们来点不同的。每到整点时提醒自己记得内识。一整天重复对自己说：“我会记得内识。我会记住内识。”时刻铭记着，你尚不知道内识是什么，但确信它与你同在。它源自上帝，是上帝在你内心的意志。它是你真实的自我。因此，你学会追随伟大的内识。在有限的状态中，你获得通向无限上帝的通道。因此，今天你成为通往内识的桥梁。</p><p>Therefore, repeat upon the hour that you will remember Knowledge. Do not forget your practice today so that you may strengthen and empower yourself.</p><p>因此，请每到整点重复你将记住内识的承诺。今天不要忘记你的实践，这样你就能够加强和赋予自己力量。</p><p>Practice 112: Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 112： 每小时练习</p>]]></content>

Let not anxieties or the burden of concern take you away from your practice today.</p><p>今天，请放心，因为内识与你同在，你的老师们与你同在，你的精神家庭与你同在。不要让焦虑或担忧的重担使你远离今天的实践。</p><p>As you move through the day, practicing upon the hour, remind yourself to be at ease, for Knowledge is your guide now. If it is untroubled, you need not be troubled. Release yourself from habitual preoccupations, from habitual bondage. Strengthen your resolve to do this and it will become easier in time. Then it will happen all by itself most naturally. Your mind has habits of thought. That is all they are. As they are replaced with new habits, Knowledge will begin to shine through the structure that you have imposed upon it. Here Knowledge will begin to shine forth, to guide your actions, to lead you to insight and important discovery and to give you a greater strength and certainty than you have ever known.</p><p>当你度过一天，每小时进行实践时，提醒自己放松，因为现在内识是你的向导。如果它安宁无恙，你也无需忧虑。释放自己不要被习惯性的全神贯注所困扰，从习惯性的束缚中解脱出来。坚定你做到这一点的决心，随着时间的推移会变得更容易。然后，这些变化将自然而然地发生。你的心灵有感想的习惯，它们只是习惯而已。当它们被新的习惯所取代时，内识将开始透过你所强加的结构闪耀出来。在这里，内识将开始显现，引导你的行动，带领你找到洞察力和重要的发现，并给予你比你以往任何时候都更大的力量和确定性。</p><p>In your hourly practices, therefore, utilize your selfdiscipline on your own behalf. In your two meditation practices, remain very alert but with a still mind.</p><p>因此，在每小时的实践中，为了自己的利益善用你的自律。在你的两次冥想实践中，保持非常警觉但心境平静。</p><p>Practice 111: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Be at ease. Observe the world around you. Carry out your worldly tasks. Do not exalt yourself. Do not demean yourself. This day allow everything to function as it actually does, without attempting to govern or manipulate yourself. The only exception to this is to utilize your self-discipline so that you may carry out your practices for this day.</p><p>试着做你今天所处的位置。简单一点。从容不迫。观察周围的世界。完成你的世俗任务。不要抬高自己。不要贬低自己。这一天，让一切按照实际情况运行，不要试图管理或操纵自己。唯一的例外是善用你的自律性，以便你可以进行这一天的练习。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods, repeat the affirmation for today and enter into stillness. Here you must exert the power of your mind. Here you are not attempting anything that is deceptive or anything that is unreal. You are allowing your mind to enter into its natural state, into a state of peace.</p><p>在两次较长时间的练习中，重复今天的肯定句，然后进入静心状态。在这里，你必须发挥心灵的力量。在这里，你不能尝试任何欺骗或虚幻的想法。你要让心灵进入自然状态，进入平静状态。</p><p>Practice 110: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Do not be in a hurry. You need not be in a hurry because you are with Knowledge. You may keep your appointments in the world and keep them on schedule, but within yourself do not be in a hurry. You may seek Knowledge, fulfillment and contribution, but do not be in a hurry. When you are in a hurry, you are neglecting your current step for steps you find more preferable, and how can steps be more preferable except when you are ignoring the step in front of you? You need only take the step in front of you, and the next step will arise naturally. Do not be in a hurry. You cannot go faster than you can go. Do not miss all that We are giving you to practice, which will require that you not be in a hurry.</p><p>今天每一步都优雅地迈出。不要急于求成。你无需急于求成，因为你与内识同在。你可以按时履行世间的约定，但内心不要急于求成。你可以追求内识、成就和贡献，但不要急于求成。当你急于求成时，你忽略了当前的步伐，而偏好那些你认为更好的步伐，而这些步伐怎么会更好呢，除非你忽略了眼前的步伐？你只需要迈出眼前的步伐，下一步自然会出现。不要急于求成。你不能走得比你能走得更快。不要错过我们为你提供的所有练习，这要求你不要急于求成。</p><p>Throughout the day today remind yourself upon the hour not to be in a hurry. Say to yourself, “I will not be in a hurry today,” and think a moment upon this. You may meet your worldly responsibilities without being in a hurry. You may meet your greater goals without being in a hurry. Take comfort in the fact that you are a beginning student, for beginning students do not know where they are going because they are in a position to receive, not to govern. This is a great blessing for you now and will give you the power in time to govern your mind and your affairs with Knowledge. You will be a kind ruler who will not condemn error and will not punish sinners, as you now imagine God to do.</p><p>今天整天提醒自己不要急于求成。对自己说，“今天我不会急于求成。”然后想一想这一点。你可以在不急于求成的情况下履行世间的责任。你可以在不急于求成的情况下实现更大的目标。安心于自己是一个初学者，因为初学者不知道自己要去哪里，因为他们正处于接收的位置，而不是主导的位置。这对你来说是一个巨大的祝福，并且随着时间的推移，它会赋予你以内识来管理自己的心灵和事务的力量。你将成为一个仁慈的统治者，不会谴责错误，不会像你现在想象的那样惩罚罪人。</p><p>Knowledge is not in a hurry. Why should you be? Knowledge may move you quickly or slowly. You may then move quickly or slowly, but within yourself you are not in a hurry. This is part of the mystery of life which you can now learn to discover.</p><p>内识不急于求成。你为什么要急于求成？内识可能让你快速或缓慢地行动。你可能会快速或缓慢地行动，但内心你并不急于求成。这是你现在可以学习发现的生命奥秘的一部分。</p><p>Practice 109: Hourly practice. </p><p>练习 109 ：每小时练习</p>]]></content>

All things must now be seen anew, for there is looking with Knowledge and there is looking without Knowledge. They yield different results. They encourage different evaluations and different responses. We have said that happiness is not a form of behavior, for it is much deeper than this. Therefore, do not attempt to use this idea to win favor with others or to demonstrate to yourself that you are happier than you actually are. We do not want to put a veneer of behavior upon your current experience. We want to guide you to that experience which is genuine to your nature, which expresses your nature and which contributes your nature to life.</p><p>现在所有关系都必须重新评估。所有关系都必须重新审视，因为有内识的观察和没有内识的观察会产生不同的结果。它们鼓励不同的评估和不同的回应。我们已经说过，幸福不是一种行为形式，因为它比这要深得多。因此，不要试图利用这个理念去博取他人的好感，或者向自己证明你比实际更幸福。我们不希望在你当前的经验上加上一层行为的表象。我们希望引导你到那种真正符合你自然性的体验，能够表达你的自然性并将你的自然性贡献给生命的经历。</p><p>Learn, then, again about happiness. In your two practice periods, engage your mind in investigation. Consider your ideas about happiness and the forms of behavior you think they must represent. Think of all the ways you have attempted to be happier than you are. Think of all the expectations and requirements you have placed upon yourself to be happy and to prove to yourself and to others your worth. As you recognize these things, realize that without this attempt, happiness will arise upon its own, for you are naturally happy. Without restraint, your happiness will arise upon its own, without your imposing it upon your mind and upon your body. Without your imposition, happiness will arise on its own. Think upon this today, but do not be content with simple conclusions, for you are a beginning student of Knowledge and great conclusions come later.</p><p>那么，重新学习幸福。在今天的两个练习期内，让你的心灵进行探索。思考你关于幸福的理念以及你认为它们必须表现的行为形式。想想所有你试图让自己比实际更快乐的方式。想想你为自己设定的所有期望和要求，以证明自己和他人的价值。当你意识到这些行为时，认识到没有这种企图，幸福会自行产生，因为你本质上是幸福的。没有束缚，你的幸福会自行产生，无需你强加在你的心灵和身体之上。没有你的强加，幸福会自行产生。今天思考这一点，但不要满足于简单的结论，因为你是内识的初学者，重大的结论会在以后出现。</p><p>Practice 108: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 108：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Learning to be happy is learning to accept Knowledge  today. Knowledge is happy today. If you are not happy, you are not with Knowledge. Happiness does not always mean having a smile on your face. It is not a behavior. Genuine happiness is a sense of self, a sense of wholeness and satisfaction. If a loss has occurred in your life, a loss of a loved one, you may still be happy, though you may shed tears. It is all right to shed tears, for this does not need to betray a greater happiness within you, for these also may be tears of happiness. Happiness is not a form of behavior. Let Us remind you of this. It is a sense of inner satisfaction. Knowledge will give this to you because it will simplify your life and allow your mind to concentrate on that which it is given to do in reality. This will empower you, simplify you and provide a greater harmony than you could have known before.</p><p>学会快乐就是学会自然。学会快乐就是学会接受今天的内识。内识就是今天的快乐。如果你不快乐，你就没有与内识在一起。快乐并不总是意味着脸上挂着笑容。它不是一种行为。真正的幸福是一种自我感觉，一种完整感和满足感。如果你的生活中发生了损失，失去了所爱的人，虽然你可能会流泪，但你仍然会感到幸福。流泪是正常的，因为这并不需要背叛你内心更大的幸福，因为这也可能是幸福的泪水。幸福不是一种行为。让我们提醒你这一点。它是一种内心的满足感。内识会让你获得这种满足感，因为它能简化你的生活，让你的心灵专注于它在现实中被赋予的使命。这将增强你的能力，简化你的生活，为你带来前所未有的和谐。</p><p>Therefore, in your two practice periods today, allow your mind to enter stillness once again. This is a time of quietude. This is not a practice of mental investigation, but a practice of mental stillness.</p><p>因此，在今天的两次练习中，让你的心灵再次进入静止状态。这是一个安静的时刻。这不是心理探究的练习，而是静心的练习。</p><p>Practice 107: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 107： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

There are advanced students. There are students of great accomplishment. But there are no Masters living in the world. Perfection is not found here, only contribution. Whoever remains in the world remains to learn the lessons of the world. The lessons of the world must be learned not only in your individual life, but in a life of contribution as well. Your genuine education far exceeds what you have realized thus far. It is not merely the correction of errors. It is the contribution of gifts. </p><p>世界上没有大师，因为大师的境界是在超越世界的地方达到的。这里有进阶的学生，有取得伟大成就的学生，但世界上没有大师。这里没有完美，只有贡献。无论谁留在世界上，都还需要学习世界的课程。这些课程不仅要在你个人的生命中学习，还要在贡献的生命中学习。你的真正教育远远超过你迄今为止所意识到的。它不仅仅是错误的纠正，而是礼物的贡献。</p><p>There are no Masters living in the world. Therefore, you may relieve yourself of the great burden of attempting or requiring Mastery for yourself. You yourself cannot be a Master, for life is the Master. That is the great difference that will make all of the difference for you when you come to understand its true meaning and benefit.</p><p>世界上没有大师。因此，你可以解除试图成为大师或要求自己成为大师的巨大负担。你自己无法成为大师，因为生命才是大师。这是一个伟大的差别，当你理解其真正的意义和益处时，它将为你带来一切的不同。</p><p>In your two practice periods today, think of all the individuals that you have considered to be Masters—individuals you have met, heard of or imagined, individuals in the past and individuals living presently. Think of all the qualities that have made them Masters and how you have used them to judge yourself and to evaluate your life and your behavior. It is not the purpose of advanced students to become the criteria for selfcondemnation by those of lesser capabilities. That is not their gift, though they must understand in time that their gifts will be so misconstrued.</p><p>在今天的两个练习期间，思考所有你认为是大师的人——你遇到的、听说过的或想象中的人，过去和现在存在的人。思考使他们成为大师的所有品质，以及你如何用这些品质来评判自己、评估你的生命和行为。高阶学生的目的不是成为能力较低者自我谴责的标准。这不是他们的礼物，尽管他们必须在时间中理解他们的礼物会被如此误解。</p><p>Accept your unburdening as We remind you that there are no Masters living in the world. In your two longer practice periods, try to realize this. Try to realize the relief that is being given to you. But do not make the mistake of thinking that this leads to passivity on your part, for greater than ever will be your involvement in the reclamation of Knowledge. Greater than ever will be your commitment to the emergence of Knowledge. Now your involvement and commitment may move forward more rapidly, for they are becoming unburdened by your idealism, which can only lead you astray.</p><p>接受你的减负，因为我们提醒你，世界上没有大师。在今天的两个较长的练习期间，试着意识到这一点。试着意识到这是给你的解脱。但不要犯错误地认为这会导致你的被动，因为你对内识恢复的参与将比以往任何时候都更大。你对内识出现的承诺也将比以往任何时候都更强。现在，你的参与和承诺可以更快地前进，因为它们正在摆脱你的理想主义的负担，而理想主义只会使你误入歧途。</p><p>Practice 106: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 106 ：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Give special consideration today to the ideas that We have presented. Understand that these ideas must be entertained and experienced through many stages of development. Their meaning is too deep and too great to be entirely obvious to you now, yet they will serve as a reminder that Knowledge is with you and that you have come to give Knowledge in the world.</p><p>在你的回顾中，遵循以往的课程，回顾本周的指示和本周的练习。今天特别关注我们所提出的观点。要明白这些观点必须通过多阶段的发展来体验和理解。它们的意义对于你现在来说可能并不完全明显，但它们将提醒你，内识与你同在，你来到这个世界是为了传递内识。</p><p>Our teaching will thus simplify all things, which will resolve the conflicts that you carry now and which will make conflict in the future unnecessary. For to the extent that you are with Knowledge, conflict does not exist. An unconflicted life is the greatest contribution that can be given into the world, for this is a life that will spark the beginning of Knowledge in all, a spark that can carry itself into the future far beyond your individual life. It is this great spark that you are intended to give into the world, for then your giving will have no end and will serve your current generation and the generations to come.</p><p>我们的教学将简化一切，从而解决你目前所带的冲突，并使未来的冲突变得不必要。因为在你与内识同在的程度上，冲突就不存在。一个没有冲突的生命是对世界最大的贡献，因为这是一个将点燃所有人内识火花的生命，这种火花可以超越你个人的生命传递到未来。你注定要把这种伟大的火花带给世界，因为这样你的付出将没有尽头，并将服务于你当前的一代和未来的世代。</p><p>The blessings that you are now experiencing today in your world are the result of these reverberations which are passed from generation to generation as Knowledge is kept alive in the world. The opportunity for you to have Knowledge is born of the giving of those who have lived before, as your giving will provide the opportunity for freedom for those who will follow. This is your greater purpose in life: to keep Knowledge alive in the world. But first you must learn of Knowledge—learn how to recognize it, learn how to accept it, learn how to discern it from the other impulses in your mind and learn the many stages of development that will be required in following Knowledge towards its great fulfillment. That is why you are a beginning student of Knowledge.</p><p>你今天在世界上所经历的祝福是这些从一代传递到另一代的内识回响的结果。你拥有内识的机会是由于那些在你之前生活过的人们的付出，同样，你的付出也将为那些后续的人们提供自由的机会。这是你生命中的更大目的：保持内识在世界上的活力。但首先你必须学习内识——学习如何识别它，学习如何接受它，学习如何从你心灵中的其他冲动中分辨它，以及学习在追随内识达到其伟大成就的过程中所需的多阶段发展。这就是为什么你是一个内识的初学者。</p><p>In your one long practice, undertake your Review in as much detail as possible. Allow confusion and uncertainty to exist, for this is necessary in this stage of investigation. Be happy, then, for all the things that can be truly recognized and know that Knowledge is with you, so you are free to be uncertain.</p><p>在你一次长时间的练习中，尽可能详细地进行回顾。允许困惑和不确定性存在，因为这是调查阶段所必需的。那么，对于所有可以真正认识到的事物感到高兴，并知道内识与你同在，所以你可以自由地感到不确定。</p><p>Practice 105: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 105：一次长时间的练习</p>]]></content>

That must be obvious if you have considered yourself honestly. And yet consider the implications of this. If God knows more about you than you do, then would not God’s evaluation be something that you would want to learn to investigate? Of course it would. And would not your evaluations of yourself be necessarily in error? In this alone you have sinned, for sin is only error. Error calls for correction, not condemnation. You would condemn yourself and think that God would then follow your example and render to you a greater condemnation. That is why people have made God in their image, and that is why you must unlearn what you have made, so that you may find what you know and so that your creations in this world may be for good and have lasting value.</p><p>上帝确实比你更了解你自己。如果你诚实地审视自己，这一点应该是显而易见的。然而，考虑一下这其中的含义。如果上帝比你更了解你自己，那么上帝的评估不是你想要学习并研究的吗？当然是的。那么你对自己的评估必然是错误的吗？仅在这一点上你就已经犯了罪，因为罪只不过是错误。错误需要纠正，而不是谴责。你会谴责自己，并认为上帝会效仿你的例子，对你进行更大的谴责。这就是为什么人们按照自己的形象创造了上帝，也是为什么你必须去忘掉你所创造的经验，这样你才能找到你所知道的，并让你在这个世界上的创造是有益且有持久价值的。</p><p>God knows more about you than you do. Do not pretend you can create yourself, for you have already been created and that which has been genuinely created is far greater and happier than the life that you have realized thus far. It is your unhappiness that is bringing you to truth, for it is driving you to a genuine resolution. This, of course, is true.</p><p>上帝比你更了解你自己。不要假装你可以创造自己，因为你已经被创造了，而且真正被创造的内识远比你迄今为止所认识到的生命要伟大和幸福。正是你的不幸福把你带到了真理面前，因为它正在驱使你寻找真正的解决方案。这当然是事实。</p><p>On the hour repeat this statement and consider it seriously. As you do so, observe the world around you in order to attempt to learn of the meaning of today’s idea in the world.

In the past you have attempted to be something unreal, and it has failed you. Now you are afraid to be anything for fear that failure will pursue you once again. Thus, greatness appears to be littleness and littleness appears to be greatness, and all things are seen backwards or reversed from their true meaning.</p><p>你受到上帝的荣耀，然而这句话会激起你的不确定感，唤起你的负罪感，混淆你的自豪感，激发你内心深处的各种冲突。过去，你曾试图成为某种虚幻的人，但你失败了。现在，你什么都不敢做了，生怕失败会再次找上你。因此，伟大看似渺小，渺小看似伟大，一切关系都被颠倒或扭曲了其真正的意义。</p><p>You are honored by God whether you can accept this or not. It is true regardless of human evaluation, for only things that are beyond evaluation are true. We are taking you to that which is beyond evaluation, which will be the greatest discovery possible in this life or in any life.</p><p>无论你能否接受，你都是上帝的荣耀。无论人类如何评价，这都是真实的，因为只有在评价之外的关系才是真实的。我们将带你进入那评价之外的世界，这将是你今生或任何生命中最伟大的发现。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement and consider it seriously. In your two practice periods, allow your mind once again to be still and receptive so that you may learn to receive the honor that God has for you. Surely, this honor must be directed towards a part of you that you are barely aware of. It is not your behavior that is honored. It is not your idealism that is honored. It is not your beliefs, your assumptions, your demands or your fears. These may be for good or for ill. These may serve you or betray you. But honor is reserved for something greater, which you are now learning to recognize.</p><p>每小时重复这句话，并认真思考。在你的两次练习中，让你的心灵再次安静下来并接纳，这样你就能学会接收上帝给你的荣誉。当然，这种荣誉一定是针对你几乎没有意识到的一部分的。获得荣誉的不是你的行为。获得荣誉的不是你的理想主义。它不是你的信仰、假设、要求或恐惧。这些可能是好的，也可能是坏的。它们可能为你服务，也可能背叛你。但荣誉是为更伟大的关系保留的，你现在正在学习认识它。</p><p>Practice 103: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Thus, your vehicle for giving is burdened and cluttered, and your energy is largely misappropriated. That is why it is God’s first step to unburden you. Until this happens you will simply attempt to resolve your situation without knowing what to do, without understanding your predicament and without accepting the assistance that you will surely need in time. Therefore, accept your unlearning, for it will unburden you and give you reassurance that a greater life is possible and inevitable for you who have come here to give.</p><p>你的生命充满了你自己的需求和想法，充满了你自己的要求和野心，充满了你自己的恐惧和复杂性。因此，你给予的载体负担重重，杂乱无章，而你的能量在很大程度上被误用。这就是为什么上帝的第一步是让你解除负担。在这种情况发生之前，你将只会试图解决自己的状况，却不知道该怎么做，不理解自己的困境，也不接受你将来必然需要的帮助。因此，接受你的忘却学习，因为它将为你解除负担，并向你保证，一个更伟大的生命对你是可能且不可避免的，因为你来到这里是为了给予。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement and consider it. View its reality in terms of your perception of the world. In your two longer practice periods, once again practice mental stillness in silence, where nothing is attempted and where nothing is avoided. You are only engaging your mind to be still so that it may learn to respond upon its own to that which calls to it. With each step you make in your unlearning, Knowledge will fill in that which had replaced it. This is instantaneous, for you are only moving yourself into a position to receive so that your giving may be generous, genuine and fulfilling to you.</p><p>每小时重复这句话并思考它。根据你对世界的看法来审视它的现实。在两次较长的练习时间里，再次练习在沉默中保持心灵的平静，不尝试任何事，也不回避任何事。你只是让你的心灵保持平静，这样它才能自然而然地对其呼唤作出回应。随着你每一步的忘却，内识将填补它所取代的遗忘。这是瞬间完成的，因为你只是在让自己处于一个接收的位置，这样你的给予才能慷慨、真实，并使你充实。</p><p>Practice 102: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 102：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习一次。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第一百零一阶：世界需要我，但我需要等待</title>

Does this not seem inconsistent with the teaching that We are presenting? It is actually not inconsistent at all if you understand its meaning. Since the world needs you, waiting would seem to be an injustice and an irresponsibility. Is this not inconsistent with what We are teaching? No, it is not inconsistent if you understand its meaning. If you have seriously considered what We have given you thus far in your preparation, you will realize that on its own, Knowledge within you will respond to the world, and you will feel moved to give in certain places and not moved to give in others. This great response within you will not be born of personal weakness, personal insecurity or the need for acceptance or recognition. It will not be a form of avoidance or guilt. In fact, it will have nothing to do with you at all. That is why it is very great, for it is not meant to remedy your littleness, but to demonstrate the power of Knowledge that exists in the world so that you may bear witness to it and be a vehicle for its expression.</p><p>当世界需要你时，为什么要等待呢？这看起来似乎与我们所传授的教导不一致。如果你理解其含义，实际上并不矛盾。因为世界需要你，等待似乎是不公正和不负责任的。这与我们所教导的矛盾吗？不，如果你理解其含义，就不会矛盾。如果你认真考虑到目前为止我们给你的准备，你会意识到，你内在的内识会自动对世界做出回应，你会感到被推动在某些地方给予，而在其他地方却没有这种冲动。这种内在的伟大回应不会源于个人的弱点、个人的不安全感或对接受和认可的需求。它不会是一种逃避或内疚的形式。实际上，它与你无关。这就是为什么它非常伟大，因为它不是为了补救你的渺小，而是为了展示世界上存在的内识的力量，以便你能见证它并成为其表达的载体。</p><p>Why wait when the world needs you? Because you are not yet ready to give. Why wait when the world needs you? Because you do not understand its need yet. Why wait when the world needs you? Because you will give for the wrong reasons and will only fortify your dilemma. The time of giving will come, and your life will give of itself, and you will be prepared to accept this, to respond to it and to follow the guidance of Knowledge that is within you. If you are to be of true service to the world, you must be prepared, and that is what We are undertaking now. </p><p>当世界需要你时，为什么要等待？因为你还没有准备好给予。当世界需要你时，为什么要等待？因为你还不了解它的需求。当世界需要你时，为什么要等待？因为你会因为错误的理由而给予，这只会加剧你的困境。给予的时机将会到来，你的生命将自然而然地给予，而你将准备好接受它，对它做出回应并遵循你内在内识的指导。如果你要真实服务于世界，你必须做好准备，这正是我们现在正在进行的工作。</p><p>Let not the tribulations of the world give you great anxiety. Let not the threats of destruction arouse your fear. Let not the injustices of this world stimulate your anger, for if they do, you are looking without Knowledge. You are seeing your own failed idealism. This is not the way of seeing, and so it is not the way of giving. You were sent to give, and your giving is intrinsic to you. You do not need to control it, for it will give of itself when you are prepared. Therefore, your service to the world at this moment is your preparation to be a contributor, and though this will not give you instant gratification for your need to give, it will pave the way for a greater service to be rendered.</p><p>不要让世界的苦难引发你的巨大焦虑。不要让毁灭的威胁引发你的恐惧。不要让这个世界的不公引发你的愤怒，因为如果你这样做了，你就是在没有内识的情况下看待问题。你看到了你自己失败的理想主义。这不是一种正确的看法，所以这也不是一种正确的给予方式。你被派来给予，而你的给予将是内在的。你不需要控制它，因为当你准备好时，它会自然而然地给予。因此，你此刻对世界的服务就是为成为贡献者而做准备，尽管这不会立即满足你给予的需求，但它将为更大的服务铺平道路。</p><p>In your two practice periods today, actively think about today’s idea and consider it in light of your behavior, your inclinations, your ideas and your beliefs.</p><p>今天在两次练习期间，积极思考今天的想法，并结合你的行为、倾向、想法和信念来考虑它。</p><p>Practice 101: Two 30-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 101：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Accept this starting place. Do not claim more for yourself,  for you do not understand the road to Knowledge. On the road to greater assumptions you may have garnered great rewards for yourself, but that leads in another direction from the road to Knowledge, where all things that are unreal are relinquished and all things that are genuine are embraced. The road to Knowledge is not a road that people have imagined for themselves, for it is not born of imagination.</p><p>你是内识的初学者。接受这个起点。不要为自己宣称更多，因为你不理解通往内识的道路。在追求更大成就的道路上，你可能已经为自己赢得了很多奖赏，但那条道路与通往内识的道路不同。在通往内识的道路上，一切不真实的关系都会被放弃，一切真实的关系都会被拥抱。通往内识的道路不是人们为自己想象的道路，因为它不是由想象而生的。</p><p>Therefore, be a beginning student of Knowledge. Upon the hour repeat this statement and give it serious consideration. Regardless of your view of yourself, whether it is exalted or diminished, no matter what you have done before, no matter what you consider your accomplishments to be, you are a beginning student of Knowledge. As a beginning student you will want to learn everything that can be learned, and you will not have the burden of defending that which you think you have claimed already. This will ease your burden in life considerably and give you the possibility for true motivation and enthusiasm, which are lacking now.</p><p>因此，成为内识的初学者。在每个小时重复这句话，并认真思考它。无论你对自己的看法如何，无论是崇高还是卑微，无论你之前做了什么，无论你认为自己的成就是什么，你都是内识的初学者。作为一名初学者，你会想要学习一切可以学习的关系，你不会有负担去捍卫你认为自己已经拥有的关系。这会极大地减轻你生命中的负担，并给你带来真实的动机和热情，这是现在所缺乏的。</p><p>Be a beginning student of Knowledge. Begin your two longer practice periods with this affirmation and allow yourself to sit in stillness and to receive. Without petitions, without questions and without expectations or demands, allow your mind to be quiet, for you are a beginning student of Knowledge and do not yet know what to ask for or what to expect.</p><p>成为内识的初学者。以这一肯定开始你的两个较长的练习时段，并允许自己静坐接收。不带任何请求，不带任何问题，不带任何期待或要求，允许你的心灵安静下来，因为你是内识的初学者，还不知道该请求什么或期待什么。</p><p>Practice 100: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Look on the world silently. Allow your mind to be still.</p><p>今天，练习不责怪世界，不评判世界的明显错误，也不把这些错误归咎于他人。静静地看着这个世界，让你的心灵保持平静。</p><p>Practice this upon the hour and view the world with your eyes open. In your two longer practice periods, also practice with eyes open looking upon the world. It does not matter what you look at, for it is all the same. Your concentration today will be to look without judgment, for this will develop your real faculties of mind.</p><p>每小时练习一次，睁开眼睛看这个世界。在两次较长的练习时间里，也要睁着眼睛看这个世界。你看什么并不重要，因为一切都是一样的。今天你的注意力集中在不带判断地看待世界上，这将培养你真正的心智能力。</p><p>Therefore, in your practice periods, practice looking with your eyes open, looking without judging. Look about your immediate environment. Look only upon things that are actually there. Do not engage in imagination. Do not let your thoughts wander to the past or to the future. Witness only what is there. As thoughts arise that are judgments, simply dismiss them without considering them, for today you are practicing seeing—seeing without judgment so that you may see what is actually there.</p><p>因此，在练习期间，练习睁着眼睛看，不带判断地看。观察你周围的环境，只看实际存在的世界。不要进行想象，不要让你的思绪游离到过去或未来。只见实际存在的世界。当产生判断的想法时，简单地将其排除，不去考虑它们，因为今天你在练习看——不带判断地看，以便你能看到实际存在的世界。</p><p>Practice 99: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Honestly evaluate your engagement with these lessons and recognize what they have yielded for you in terms of understanding. Try to be very fair in your assessment. Remember that you are a student. Do not claim that you have realized more than you have actually experienced.</p><p>在回顾中，再次回顾本课的所有指令以及你在过去一周的练习中迄今为止所经历的一切。诚实地评估你对这些课程的参与情况，并认识到这些课程在理解方面给你带来的收获。在评估时要尽量公平。记住，你是一名学生。不要声称你所领悟的比你实际经历的多。</p><p>The simplicity of this approach may seem obvious, but for many people it is very difficult to achieve, for they are so used to thinking that they have more than they have or less than they have that it is very difficult for them to assess their actual circumstances even though their circumstances are quite obvious.</p><p>这种方法的简单性可能显而易见，但对许多人来说却很难实现，因为他们习惯于认为自己拥有的比实际更多或更少，因此很难评估他们的实际情况，尽管他们的情况非常明显。</p><p>In your one long practice period, then, review your lessons and consider each one in depth, recalling your activity with them on the day that they were given and your understanding of them at this moment. Review each of the six previous steps very carefully and beware of making conclusions that do not represent your true experience. It is better to be uncertain than to have false conclusions.</p><p>因此，在你一次长时间的练习中，复习你的课程并深入思考每一课，回想它们在那天给你的活动以及你此刻对它们的理解。非常仔细地回顾前六步的每一步，并注意不要得出不代表你真实体验的结论。宁愿不确定，也不要得出错误的结论。</p><p>Practice 98: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 98：一次长时间的练习</p>]]></content>

Is it a resignation to hopelessness? No, it is not. It is the beginning of true honesty. When you realize how little you understand and yet realize at the same time the great offer of Knowledge that is available to you, only then will you seize upon this opportunity with great encouragement and dedication. You can only imagine fulfillment, but within you the Knowledge of fulfillment lives and burns. This is a fire that you cannot put out. This is a fire that exists within you now. This represents your greater yearning for fulfillment, for union and for contribution. Far beneath all of your hopes and fears, beneath your plans and ambitions, this fire is burning now. Relinquish, then, your ideas concerning fulfillment, but do not be hopeless, for you are placing yourself in a position to receive the gifts that are intended for you. You have brought these gifts with you into the world. They are hidden within you where you cannot find them.</p><p>这句话是在承认自己的软弱吗？是自认无望吗？不，不是。它是真正诚实的开始。当你意识到自己所知甚少，但同时又意识到内识为你提供的巨大机遇时，你才会以极大的鼓励和奉献精神抓住这个机会。你只能想象实现，但在你的内心深处，实现的内识却存在并燃烧着。这是一团你无法扑灭的火焰。这是一团现在就存在于你体内的火焰。这代表着你对实现、结合和贡献的更大渴望。在你所有的希望和恐惧之下，在你的计划和野心之下，这把火正在燃烧。那么，放弃你关于实现的想法吧，但不要绝望，因为你正在将自己置于收到礼物的位置上。你把这些礼物带到了这个世界。它们藏在你的身体里，在你找不到的地方。</p><p>You do not know what fulfillment is. Happy stimulation alone cannot be fulfillment, for fulfillment is a state of quietude. It is a state of inner acceptance. It is a state of total integration. It is a timeless state expressing itself in time. How can even the happiest stimulation give you that which can abide in any circumstance and which does not cease when the stimulation is over? We do not wish to deprive you of happy stimulations, for they can be very good, but they are momentary and can only give you a glimpse of the greater possibility. Here We wish to take you directly to the greater possibility by cultivating the great resources within your mind and by teaching you a way of seeing the world so that you may learn of its true purpose.</p><p>你不知道什么是满足。仅有快乐的刺激不能算是满足，因为满足是一种安静的状态。它是一种内心接纳的状态。它是一种完全融合的状态。它是一种在时间中表达自己的永恒状态。即使是最快乐的刺激，又怎么能给你一种在任何情况下都能保持，并且在刺激结束时也不会停止的状态呢？我们并不想剥夺你快乐的刺激，因为它们可能非常好，但它们只是瞬间的，只能让你瞥见更大的可能性。在这里，我们希望通过开发你心灵中的巨大资源，教给你一种看待世界的方式，让你了解世界的真正目的，从而直接带你走向更大的可能性。</p><p>Therefore, upon the hour today, repeat today’s idea and consider it seriously in view of yourself and the world around you. Today, in your two long practice periods, once again spend time seriously considering this idea. Remember to think of your own life in these practice periods and apply today’s idea to the plans that you are aware of concerning your own fulfillment. These thinking meditations require mental work. Here you will not be still. You will be investigating. You will be exploring. You will be actively using your mind to penetrate things that you recognize exist there. This is a time for serious introspection. When you realize that what you thought you knew is only a form of imagination, then you will realize your great need for Knowledge.</p><p>因此，今天一到时间，就重复今天的想法，并认真考虑它与你自己以及你周围世界的关系。今天，在你的两次长时间练习中，再次花时间认真思考这个想法。记住，在这些练习时间里，要想想你自己的生活，把今天的想法应用到你所知道的与你自己的成就有关的计划中去。这些思考冥想需要进行心理工作。在这里，你不会一动不动。你将进行调查。你要探索。你将积极地运用你的心灵去洞察你所认识到的关系。这是一个认真反思的时刻。当你意识到你以为你知道的只是想象的一种形式时，你就会意识到你对内识的巨大需求。</p><p>You must understand what you have in order to learn to receive more. If you think you have more than you actually have, then you are impoverished without even being aware of it and will not understand the Great Plan that has been created on your behalf. You must start from where you are, for in this way you may proceed, each step certain, each step forward, built upon the step before. There will be no falling back here, for you will be firmly established on your path to Knowledge.</p><p>你必须理解你所拥有的一切，才能学习收到更多。如果你认为自己拥有的比实际拥有的更多，那么你就会在不知不觉中陷入贫困，也就无法理解为你制定的伟大计划。你必须从现在开始，因为这样你才能继续前进，每一步都是确定的，每一步都是在前一步的基础上向前迈进的。在这里，你不会后退，因为你将在通往内识的道路上站稳脚跟。</p><p>Practice 97: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 97： 两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习一次。</p>]]></content>

A Greater Will exists within you that wishes to express itself. When you experience this, you will finally feel that you are known to yourself. You will finally experience true happiness, for your life at last will be integrated. You must be unburdened to make this discovery. Nothing of value will be taken from you. It is not God’s intent to make you lonely and forlorn, but to give you the opportunity to realize your true promise so that you may proceed with strength and true motivation.</p><p>上帝在拯救和赋予你力量的第一步是解除你不必要的负担，解除那些无法让你感到幸福的负担，解除那些只会带来痛苦的负担，并从你的头上摘下那象征着你在世间追求满足的荆棘冠冕。在你内心中存在着一个更伟大的意志，它希望表达它自身。当你体验到这一点时，你会终于感受到你是被自己所知道的。你将最终体验到真实的幸福，因为你的生命终于整合在一起。你必须解除负担才能进行这个发现。你不会失去任何有价值的关系。上帝的意志不是让你孤独和绝望，而是给你机会去实现你的真实承诺，以便你可以以力量和真实的动机继续前行。</p><p>Therefore, accept this first great offer to unburden you from the hopeless conflicts that you attempt to resolve, from meaningless pursuits which lead you nowhere, from false promises of this world and from your own idealism which paints a picture the world cannot possibly support. In simplicity and humility the greatness of life will dawn upon you, and you will know that you have given away nothing for something of the greatest value.</p><p>因此，接受这个解除你无望的冲突、无意义的追求、虚假的世界承诺以及你自己无法支持的理想画面的伟大提议。在简单和谦逊中，生命的伟大将会展现在你面前，你会知道你没有为了换取最有价值的内识而失去任何关系。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement and think about it. Observe its meaning in terms of your current circumstances. Observe its demonstration in the lives of people all around you. Observe its reality in terms of your own existence, which you are now learning to witness objectively. </p><p>每小时重复这一声明并思考它。观察它在你当前环境中的意义。观察它在人们生活中的体现。观察它在你自己存在中的现实，你现在正在学习客观地见证这一点。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods today, attempt to concentrate on this idea and apply it to your life specifically. Actively engage your mind and try to think of the meaning of this statement in terms of your current ambitions, your current plans, and so forth. Many things may be cast in doubt as you do this, but realize that Knowledge is not affected by your schemes and plans or by your hopes and disappointments. It is only awaiting the time when it can emerge naturally within you, and you will be the first recipient of its great gifts.</p><p>在今天的两个较长的练习时段中，尝试专注于这个想法并将其具体应用到你的生命中。积极地运用你的心灵，尝试思考这一声明在你的当前抱负、计划等方面的意义。当你这样做时，许多事情可能会被怀疑，但请意识到，内识不会受到你的计划、希望或失望的影响。它只是在等待自然地在你内心中出现的时刻，而你将是其伟大礼物的第一个受益者。</p><p>Practice 96: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 96：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第九十五阶：我怎么可能实现我的自我？</title>
      <link href="/2024/06/27/95/"/>
      <url>/2024/06/27/95/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-95-HOW-CAN-I-POSSIBLY-FULFILL-MYSELF"><a href="#STEP-95-HOW-CAN-I-POSSIBLY-FULFILL-MYSELF" class="headerlink" title="STEP 95  HOW CAN I POSSIBLY FULFILL MYSELF?"></a>STEP 95  HOW CAN I POSSIBLY FULFILL MYSELF?</h2><p>How can you possibly fulfill yourself when you do not know who you are, when you do not know where you have come from or where you are going, when you do not know who has sent you and who will be waiting for you when you return? How can you possibly fulfill yourself alone when you are part of life itself? Can you fulfill yourself apart from life? Only in fantasy and imagination can you possibly even entertain the idea of fulfilling yourself. There is no fulfillment here, only increasing confusion. As the years progress, you will feel a growing darkness within you, as if a great opportunity has been lost. Do not lose this opportunity to realize life as it truly exists and to receive fulfillment as it is truly offered to you.</p><p>当你不知道自己是谁，不知道自己从哪里来或将要去哪里，不知道是谁派遣了你、谁将在你回归时等待你时，你怎么可能实现自我？当你是生命本身的一部分时，你怎么可能独自实现自我？你能在脱离生命的情况下实现自我吗？只有在幻想和想象中，你才能甚至考虑实现自我的想法。在这里没有满足，只有越来越多的困惑。随着岁月的流逝，你会感觉到内心越来越黑暗，仿佛失去了一个大好机会。不要失去这个机会，去认识真正存在的生命，去接收真正提供给你的满足。</p><p>Only in imagination can you fulfill yourself otherwise, and imagination is not reality. Accepting this may at first seem like a limitation and a disappointment, for you already have designs and motives for your own personal fulfillment, whether they have been experienced or not. Your entire agenda for your fulfillment must now be brought into question, not to deprive you of anything of value, but to release you from a bondage which could only deceive and disappoint you in time. Therefore, accepting the hopelessness of your attempt to fulfill yourself opens you finally to receive the great gift which is available to you and which is awaiting you. This great gift is meant to be given through you into the world in a way that is specific for your happiness and for the happiness of those who will naturally be drawn to you.</p><p>否则，你只能在想象中实现自我，而想象并非现实。接受这一点起初可能会感觉像是一种限制和失望，因为你已经为自己的个人成就制定了计划和动机，无论这些计划是否已经实现。现在，你对自我成就的整个计划必须受到质疑，不是为了剥夺你任何有价值的成就，而是为了将你从一种只能在时间中欺骗和令你失望的束缚中解放出来。因此，接受你尝试实现自我的无望，最终会让你开放去接受那个已经为你准备好并在等待你的伟大礼物。这个伟大的礼物旨在通过你以一种特定的方式带到世界上，为你的幸福以及那些自然会被你吸引的人们的幸福服务。</p><p>How can you possibly fulfill yourself? Upon the hour today, repeat this question and give it a moment of serious consideration, regardless of your circumstances. As you practice upon the hour, look out into the world and see how people are trying to fulfill themselves, both in situations that now exist and in situations that are hoped for. Understand how much this separates them from life as it truly exists. Understand how this separates them from the mystery of their own existence and the wonder of life that they are free to encounter every moment of every day. Do not allow yourself to be so deprived. Fantasy will always paint a grand picture for you, but it has no foundation in reality. Only those who attempt to fortify each other’s fantasies will attempt relationship with each other for this purpose, and their disappointment will be mutual, for which they will be inclined to blame each other. Do not seek, then, that which can only bring you unhappiness and only destroy the great opportunity for relationship for you.</p><p>你怎么可能实现自我？今天每小时重复这个问题，并认真考虑一下，不论你处于何种境况。每小时练习时，看看世界，看看人们如何试图实现自我，无论是在现有的情况下，还是在希望中的情况下。理解这如何将他们与真实的生命分离。理解这如何将他们与自己存在的神秘和每天每刻都能自由遇见的生命奇迹分离。不要让自己如此被剥夺。幻想总会为你描绘一幅宏伟的画面，但它在现实中没有基础。只有那些试图互相强化彼此幻想的人，才会为了这个目的而尝试建立关系，他们的失望将是相互的，他们将倾向于相互指责。因此，不要去追求那些只会带来不幸并且破坏你伟大关系机会的关系。</p><p>Upon the hour repeat this statement. In your two practice periods, enter stillness and receptivity so that you may learn to receive fulfillment as it truly exists.</p><p>每小时重复这句话。在你的两次练习期间，进入静心和接纳状态，以便你能学会收到真正存在的满足。</p><p>Practice 95: Two 30-minute practice periods. Hourly practice.</p><p>练习95：两个 30 分钟的练习时段。每小时练习。</p>]]></content>

      <title>第九十四阶：我的自由是找到我的目的</title>
      <link href="/2024/06/26/94/"/>
      <url>/2024/06/26/94/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-94-MY-FREEDOM-IS-TO-FIND-MY-PURPOSE"><a href="#STEP-94-MY-FREEDOM-IS-TO-FIND-MY-PURPOSE" class="headerlink" title="STEP 94  MY FREEDOM IS TO FIND MY PURPOSE."></a>STEP 94  MY FREEDOM IS TO FIND MY PURPOSE.</h2><p>What value can freedom possibly have except to enable you to find your purpose and to fulfill it? Without purpose, freedom is merely the right to be chaotic, the right to live without external restraint. But without external restraint, you will merely act out the harshness of your internal restraint. Is this an improvement? Overall it is not an improvement, though it can lead to opportunities for self-discovery.</p><p>自由可能具有怎样的价值，除非它能够让你找到并实现你的目的？没有目的，自由只是混乱的权利，只是没有外部约束地生活的权利。但是没有外部约束，你只会表现出你内在约束的严酷性。这是改善吗？总体而言，这不是一种改善，尽管它可以带来自我发现的机会。</p><p>DO NOT CALL CHAOS FREEDOM, for this is not freedom. Do not think that because others do not limit you that you are in an exalted state. Realize that your freedom is to enable you to find your purpose and to fulfill it. Understanding freedom in this way will enable you to utilize all aspects of your life—your current situation, your relationships, your involvements, your successes, your errors, your attributes and your limitations—everything on behalf of discovering your purpose. For when a greater purpose begins to express itself through you in a manner that you can recognize and accept, you will feel at last that your life is being completely integrated. You will no longer be separate individuals within yourself, but one person, whole and unified, with all aspects of yourself engaged in serving this one purpose.</p><p>不要称混乱为自由，因为这不是自由。不要认为因为其他人不限制你，你就处于一种崇高的状态。要意识到你的自由是为了让你找到并实现你的目的。以这种方式理解自由，将使你能够使用生命的各个方面——你当前的情况、你的人际关系、你的参与、你的成功、你的错误、你的属性和你的局限——一切都为了发现你的目的。当一个更伟大的目的开始通过你表达出来，以一种你可以识别和接受的方式时，你最终会感到你的生命得到了完全的整合。你将不再在自己的内部分裂，而是一个人，完整且统一，所有方面都参与服务于这个目的。</p><p>The freedom to commit errors will not redeem you. Errors can be committed under any circumstances, and freedom can be found under any circumstances. Therefore, seek to learn about freedom. Knowledge will express itself when it is unfettered and when you as a person have developed sufficiently to be able to carry its great mission in the world. Your Spiritual Teachers, who abide with you beyond your visual sight, are here to initiate you into Knowledge. They have their own method for doing this, for they understand the true meaning of freedom and its true purpose in the world.</p><p>犯错的自由不会拯救你。错误可以在任何情况下犯下，自由也可以在任何情况下找到。因此，寻求学习自由。内识会在不受束缚时表达自己，而当你作为一个人已经足够发展以承载它在世界上的伟大使命时，你的精神老师，他们超越你视觉视野的存在，正在这里引导你进入内识。他们有自己的方法，因为他们理解自由的真实含义及其在世界上的真实目的。</p><p>Therefore, in your practice periods We once again affirm the power of this statement and give you two opportunities to experience it deeply within yourself. You do not need to try to speculate about this mentally, but simply relax so that it can be experienced. Focus your mind completely to allow it to experience the greatness of the presence of God that is with you and that is within you, for this is looking in the direction of freedom where freedom truly exists.</p><p>因此，在你的练习期间，我们再次确认这一陈述的力量，并给你两次机会在内心深处体验它。你不需要试图在心智上去推测，而是简单地放松以便体验。完全专注于让自己感受到上帝的伟大存在，因为这是朝向真正自由的方向。</p><p>Practice 94: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习94：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You have come here for a purpose, to remember your True Home while you are in the world. The great purpose that you carry is with you at this moment, and it will arise in stages as you undergo the preparation that We are providing for you. This purpose is greater than all the purposes you have imagined for yourself. It is greater than all the purposes you have attempted to live for yourself. It does not need your imagination or your creations, for it will fulfill itself through you and will integrate you perfectly as it does so. There is a purpose for you to fulfill in the world. You are now preparing step by step to experience and to learn to accept this so that it may yield its great gifts to you.</p><p>你被派往这个世界是有目的的，那就是贡献出你的礼物，这些礼物将从内识中散发出来。你来到这里是有目的的，那就是在你来到这个世界的时候，记住你真实的家。此时此刻，你的伟大使命与你同在，它将随着你收到我们为你提供的准备工作而分阶段出现。这个目的比你为自己所想象的所有目的都要伟大。它比你试图为自己实现的所有目的都要伟大。它不需要你的想象或创造，因为它会通过你实现它自己，并在实现过程中完美地融入你。在这个世界上，有一个目的需要你去实现。你现在正一步一步地准备去体验并学会接受它，这样它就会向你交付它的伟大礼物。</p><p>In your two practice periods, affirm the reality of this statement. In stillness and receptivity, allow your mind to settle into its true function. Allow yourself to be a student, which means allowing yourself to be receptive and responsible for utilizing that which is provided for you. Let this day be an affirmation of your true life in the world, not the life that you have made for yourself.</p><p>在你的两次练习中，确认这句话的真实性。在静心和接纳的状态下，让你的心沉淀下来，发挥它真实的功能。让自己成为一名学生，这意味着让自己善于接受并负责任地使用为你提供的一切。让这一天成为你在世界上真实生命的肯定，而不是你为自己创造的生命。</p><p>Practice 93: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 93：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You have come to serve the world in its present needs.  You have come to prepare for future generations. Can all of this be meaningful to you personally now? Perhaps not, because you are working for the present and for the future. You are working for the life that you will live and for lives that will follow yours. This is fulfilling to you now, for this is your gift that you have come to give. Without pretense and without uncertainty, this will arise from you naturally and will give itself into the world. Weaving your life with other lives in a very specific way, it is meant to uplift you and all with whom you come in contact. The Plan is greater than your personal ambition, and only your personal ambition can cloud your vision of what you must do. Be thankful, then, today that there is a role for you to fulfill in the world. You have come into the world to fulfill this role—for your own fulfillment, for the advancement of your world and for service to your Spiritual Family.</p><p>你在一个至关重要的时刻来到这个世界。你来服务当下世界的需求。你来为后代做准备。所有这些对你现在是否有意义呢？也许不是，因为你为现在和未来而工作。你为将要生活的世界上的生命，以及接下来将跟随你的生命而工作。这对你来说现在是充实的，因为这是你来给予的礼物。没有伪装，没有不确定性，这将自然地从你身上升起，并投入到世界中去。它以一种非常特殊的方式将你的生命与其他生命交织在一起，这意味着让你和你接触过的所有人都得到提升。这计划比你个人的野心更为伟大，只有你的个人野心才会模糊你必须做的事情的视野。因此，今天要感恩，感恩有一个角色让你在世界上履行。你来到这个世界上来履行这个角色——为了你自己的满足，为了你世界的进步以及为了服务你的精神家庭。</p><p>In your two practice periods today, concentrate and affirm that there is a role for you to play. Do not attempt to fill in that role according to your ideas or your wishes, but allow that role to fulfill itself, for Knowledge within you will fulfill it once you are prepared. In stillness and acceptance, affirm that there is a role for you to play in the world and experience the power and the truth of this great idea.</p><p>在你今天的两个练习时间中，集中注意力并确认你有一个角色要扮演。不要试图按照你的想法或愿望去填补这个角色，而是让这个角色自己实现，因为一旦你准备好了，你内在的内识就会实现它。在静心和接纳中，确认你在这个世界上有一个角色要扮演，并体验这个伟大想法的力量和真理。</p><p>Practice 92: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 92：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Give this time to re-experience what happened each and every day and to see this from your current experience as well. Learn how to learn. Learn about the process of learning. Do not use learning as a form of showmanship. Do not use learning to try to prove your worth to yourself. You cannot prove your worth. It is beyond your efforts to prove it. Your worth will demonstrate itself when you allow it, which you are now learning to do. Practice to practice. Some days will be easier. Some days will be harder. Some days you will want to practice. Other days you may not want to practice. Each day you practice because you are representing a Greater Will. This demonstrates consistency, which is a demonstration of power. This demonstrates a greater dedication. This gives you certainty and stability and allows you to deal compassionately with all things of lesser strength.</p><p>我们的回顾将再次集中于过去一周的指导和你的练习。花时间重新体验每一天所发生的事情，并从你当前的经验中看待这些事情。学习如何学习。了解学习的过程。不要将学习作为一种炫耀的形式。不要用学习来证明自己的价值。你无法证明自己的价值，这超出了你的努力范围。当你允许时，你的价值将自我显现，而你现在正在学习如何做到这一点。练习就是为了练习。有些日子会更容易。有些日子会更困难。有些日子你会想要练习，其他日子你可能不想练习。你每天都练习，因为你代表着更伟大的意志。这展示了一种一致性，这是一种力量的展示。这展示了更大的奉献精神。这给你带来了确定性和稳定性，并允许你以同情心处理所有较弱的事物。</p><p>Your long Review today will be an examination of your learning process.

They pull you from place to place. Perhaps in time you will be able to understand their mechanism more thoroughly. Our practice today is to emphasize that they do not control Knowledge. Knowledge does not need to destroy your emotions. It only wishes to contribute to them. In time, you will come to understand a great deal more about your emotions, and you will realize that your emotions may serve a greater purpose, as may your mind and your body. All things that have been a source of pain, discomfort and disassociation, when brought into service to one power—which is the One Power—will then become vehicles of expression serving a greater purpose. Even anger serves a greater purpose here, for it shows you that you have violated Knowledge. Though your anger may not be directed towards another, it is simply a sign that something has gone wrong and that correction has to be made. You will understand the source of grief, and you will understand the source of all emotions in time.</p><p>情感像强风一样吸引着你。情感将你从一个地方拉到另一个地方。也许随着时间的推移，你会更加彻底地理解情感的机制。我们今天的练习是强调情感并不控制内识。内识不需要摧毁你的情感。它只希望对你的情感有所贡献。随着时间的推移，你会对情感有更多的理解，你会意识到你的情感可以服务于一个更伟大的目的，就像你的心灵和身体一样。所有曾经带来痛苦、不适和分裂的事物，当它们服务于一个力量——即唯一的力量时，将会成为表达的一种载体，服务于更伟大的目的。即使是愤怒在这里也有更大的目的，因为它显示出你违反了内识。尽管你的愤怒可能并没有指向他人，但它只是一个信号，表明出了问题，需要进行纠正。你会理解悲伤的来源，并且最终你会理解所有情感的来源。</p><p>Practice upon the hour and at the beginning of your two longer meditation periods, repeat today’s idea and then enter into stillness. Today learn to value that which is certain and to understand that which is uncertain, to recognize that which is cause and that which obstructs cause but which may in time serve cause itself.</p><p>每小时练习一次，在两次较长的冥想开始时，重复今天的想法，然后进入静心状态。今天，学会珍视确定的内识，并理解不确定的情感，识别原因和阻碍原因的情感，而这些阻碍的情感可能最终也会服务于原因它本身。</p><p>Practice 89: Two 30-minute practice periods.

This is very hard to resolve from the point of view of separation. But when you think of life as an inclusive network of evolving relationships, you then begin to experience and recognize that your Higher Self is indeed part of a greater fabric of relationship. It is the part of you that is not separate but is meaningfully bonded with others. Therefore, your Higher Self is bonded to the Higher Self of your Teachers. They are without duality now, for they have no other self. You have two selves: the Self that has been created and the self that you have created. To bring the self that you have created into service to your True Self joins them together into a meaningful marriage of purpose and service and ends internal conflict forever.</p><p>关于你的高我和你的精神导师，经常会有混淆。从分离的角度来看，这很难解决。但是，当你把生命看作是一个不断演化的关系网络时，你就会开始体验并认识到，你的高我的确是更大的关系结构的一部分。它是你的一部分，不是独立的，而是与他人有意义地结合在一起。因此，你的高我与你的老师们的高我结合在一起。他们现在没有二元性，因为他们没有另一个自我。你有两个自我：被创造的自我和你创造的自我。将你所创造的自我带入对真实自我的服务中，将它们结合在一起，形成一个有意义的目标和服务的结合，从而永远结束内心的冲突。</p><p>Today upon the hour repeat your affirmation and feel its impact. In your two longer practice periods, use your affirmation as an introduction to your practice in stillness and receptivity.</p><p>今天每小时重复你的肯定语，感受它的影响。在两次较长时间的练习中，将你的肯定语作为你静心和接纳练习的引子。</p><p>Practice 88: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Upon the hour you will learn to release fear from your life, for Knowledge will dispel all fear, and you will dispel fear to give Knowledge its right to express itself. Trust what you know. It is for the greatest good. You may bear great anger and distrust towards yourself, but this is not directed at Knowledge. This is directed at your personal mind, which cannot possibly understand your greater purpose. It cannot possibly answer your greatest questions or provide certainty, purpose, meaning and direction in your life. Forgive what is fallible. Honor what is infallible. And learn to tell the two apart.</p><p>今天的每一个小时，练习重复这句话，并思考它的含义。在这一小时里，你将学会从生命中释放恐惧，因为内识会驱散一切恐惧，你将驱散恐惧，让内识有权表达它自己。相信你的内识。这是为了最大的利益。你可能会对自己充满愤怒和不信任，但这并不是针对内识的。它针对的是你的个人心智，因为它不可能理解你更伟大的目标。它不可能回答你最大的问题，也不可能为你的人生提供确定性、目的、意义和方向。原谅易错之处。尊重无懈可击的内识。并学会将两者区分开来。</p><p>In your two longer practice periods today, practice letting go of fear so that you may know. Allowing your mind to be still and receptive without making demands will be a demonstration that you are trusting Knowledge. It will give you reprieve from the afflictions and the animosities of this world. With this, you will begin to see a different world.</p><p>在今天两次较长时间的练习中，练习放下恐惧，这样你就可以知道。让你的心静止下来，接受而不提出要求，这将是你信任内识的表现。这将使你从这个世界的痛苦和敌意中解脱出来。这样，你将开始看到一个不同的世界。</p><p>Practice 87: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Today in your two deep practice periods, you are asked to think of those people who have given to you, to think of them and nothing else during your period of practice. You are asked to consider very deeply what they have done for you. With those with whom you are angry and upset, try to see how they, too, have given service to you in the reclamation of Knowledge. Do not bear false witness against your feelings, but in spite of your feelings towards them, if there are ill feelings, attempt also to recognize their service to you. For you can indeed be angered or upset by someone that you recognize has served you, and this is often the case. Perhaps you will even be angry at this curriculum which seeks only to serve you. Why would you be angry at this curriculum? Because Knowledge flushes out everything that stands in its way. That is why at times you are angry and do not even know why.</p><p>尊敬那些为你付出的人，会让你产生感激之情，而这正是真爱和感恩的开始。今天，在你的两次深度练习中，要求你想想那些为你付出的人，在练习期间只想他们，不想其他。你要深入思考他们为你所做的一切。对于那些让你感到愤怒和不安的人，试着看看他们也是如何在内识的开垦过程中为你服务的。不要对你的感情作虚假的见证，尽管你对他们有感情，如果有不愉快的感觉，也要试着承认他们对你的服务。因为你确实会被某个你承认曾为你服务过的人激怒或难过，这种情况经常发生。也许你甚至会对这门只为你服务的课程感到愤怒。你为什么会对这门课程感到愤怒呢？因为内识会冲走一切阻碍它的障碍。这就是为什么有时你会生气，甚至不知道为什么生气。</p><p>Allow your two practice periods to be quite focused. Concentrate. Use the power of your mind. Think of those individuals who have served you. If individuals come to mind whom you had not considered having served you, think how they have served you as well. Let this day be a day of recognition. Let this be a day of restitution.</p><p>让你的两次练习课相当专注。集中注意力。运用你心灵的力量。想想那些曾经为你服务过的人。如果你想到了一些你不曾想过曾为你服务过的人，想想他们是如何为你服务的。让今天成为一个承认的日子。让这一天成为一个弥补的日子。</p><p>Practice 86: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 86：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You will find happiness in  small things because you are learning to be still and observant. You will find happiness in small things because your mind is becoming receptive. You will experience happiness in small things because you are being present to your current circumstances. Small things can carry great messages if you are attentive to them. Then small things will not aggravate you.</p><p>你会在小事中找到快乐，因为快乐与你同在。你会在小事中发现幸福，因为你正学会静下来观察。你会在小事中发现幸福，因为你的心灵变得善于接纳。你会在小事中体验到幸福，因为你正在面对当前的环境。如果你细心观察，小事也能蕴含巨大的信息。这样，小事就不会让你感到烦躁。</p><p>A still mind is an aware mind. A still mind is a mind that is learning to be at peace. Peace is not a passive state. It is a state of the greatest activity, for it engages your life with great purpose and intensity, activating all of your powers and giving them uniform direction. This comes from peace. God is still, but everything from God is generated into constructive and uniform action. This is what gives form and direction to all meaningful relationships. This is why your Teachers are with you, for there is a Plan.</p><p>静心就是察觉的心。静止的心是一种学会平和的心。平静不是一种被动的状态。它是一种最活跃的状态，因为它使你的生命充满目的性和强度，激活你所有的力量，并给予它们统一的方向。这源于和平。上帝是静止的，但来自上帝的一切都会产生建设性的统一行动。这就是所有有意义的关系的形式和方向。这就是你的老师与你在一起的原因，因为有一个计划。</p><p>Practice stillness twice today in deep meditation. State your lesson’s affirmation upon the hour and consider it briefly. Allow your day to be given to practice, so practice can infuse itself into all of your other activities. </p><p>今天，在深度冥想中练习静心两次。每时每刻说出你的课程申明，并进行简要思考。让你的一天都用来练习，这样练习就能渗透到你所有的其他活动中。</p><p>Practice 85: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Review your progress objectively. Realize how great your learning must be. Your steps now are small, but substantive. Small steps lead you all the way. You are not expected to take great leaps, yet each small step will seem like a great leap, for it will give you so much more than you have ever had before. Allow your external life to become rearranged as your inner life begins to emerge and to shine its light upon you. Maintain your focus and accept change in your outer life, for it is for your benefit. Only if Knowledge is violated will the indication of error be evident to you. This will lead you to effective action. If Knowledge is not offended by the change around you, then you need not be. In time, you will achieve the peace of Knowledge. You will share in its peace, its certainty and its true gifts.</p><p>回顾上一周的练习和指导。客观地回顾自己的进步。认识到自己的学习成果有多大。你现在迈出的步子虽小，但却很实在。小步引领你前进。我们不期望你有大的飞跃，但每一小步都会让你觉得是一个巨大的飞跃，因为它将带给你前所未有的收获。当你的内在生命开始萌发并向你发出光芒时，让你的外在生活得到重新安排。保持专注，接受外在生活的改变，因为这对你有益。只有当内识受到侵犯时，你才会发现错误的迹象。这将引导你采取有效的行动。如果内识没有被你周围的变化所冒犯，那么你也不必如此。假以时日，你将获得内识的平静。你将分享它的和平、它的确定性和它真实的礼物。</p><p>Therefore, conduct your review in one long practice period today. Review with great emphasis and discrimination. Do not allow yourself to miss the recognition of your learning process.</p><p>因此，今天就在漫长的练习中进行复习吧。以高度的重视和辨别力进行复习。不要让自己错过对学习过程的认识。</p><p>Practice 84: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 84： 长时间练习</p>]]></content>

It would erase all conflicts in your thinking. It would end completely all that troubles you and perplexes you. You would not view relationships either as a form of domination or as a form of punishment. This would give you an entirely new basis of understanding in your participation with others. It would give you a frame of reference within which you would be able to develop yourself mentally and physically, keeping a greater perspective as you do so. What has disappointed you but the misappropriation of your abilities? What grieves and angers you but the misappropriation of other people’s abilities?</p><p>如果你能体验到这句话的深度和力量，你就能摆脱一切形式的束缚。它会消除你思维中的所有冲突。它将彻底终结你所有的烦恼和困惑。你不会再把人际关系视为一种支配或惩罚。这将为你与他人的交往提供一个全新的理解基础。它将为你提供一个参照系，让你在身心发展的同时，保持更高的视野。除了能力被滥用，还有什么让你失望？除了挪用他人的能力，还有什么让你悲伤和愤怒？</p><p>Value Knowledge. It is beyond your understanding. Follow Knowledge. It guides you in ways that you have never experienced. Trust Knowledge. It gives you back to yourself. Trust comes before understanding, always. Participation comes before trust, always. Therefore, participate with Knowledge.</p><p>重视内识。它超越了你的理解。追随内识。它以你从未体验过的方式指引你。信任内识。它让你回归自我。信任永远先于理解。参与永远先于信任。因此，与内识一起参与。</p><p>Remind yourself of your affirmation upon the hour. Try to be very consistent. Do not forget today to emphasize that you value Knowledge above all other things. In your two meditation practices, give this statement as an affirmation and then, in stillness, allow yourself to receive. Do not use these practices to gain answers or information, but allow yourself to become quiet, for a quiet mind can learn all things and know all things. Words are but one form of communication. You are now learning to communicate, for your mind is now opening to a greater association.</p><p>每小时提醒自己肯定。尽量保持一致。不要忘记今天强调你珍视内识胜过一切。在两次冥想练习中，将这个声明作为肯定，并在静心中，让自己接受。不要利用这些练习来获取答案或信息，而是让自己保持安静，因为安静的心灵可以学到一切并知道一切。言语只是沟通的一种形式。你现在正在学会沟通，因为你的心灵现在正在向一个更大的联系敞开。</p><p>Practice 83: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Judgment is a decision not to know. It is a decision not to look. It is a decision not to listen. It is a decision not to be still. It is a decision to follow a convenient form of thinking that keeps your mind asleep and keeps you lost within the world. The world is full of error. How could it be otherwise? Therefore, it does not require your condemnation but your constructive assistance.</p><p>我们再次练习这一课，在你学习的过程中，我们会每隔一段时间重复这一课。评判是一种不知道的决定。这是不去观察的决定。这是不倾听的决定。这是不静心的决定。它决定遵循一种方便的思维方式，让你的心灵沉睡，让你迷失在这个世界里。这个世界充满了错误。怎么可能不是这样呢？因此，它不需要你的谴责，而需要你建设性的帮助。</p><p>Do not judge another today. Remind yourself of this upon each hour and consider it briefly. Remind yourself of this in your two meditation practices, where you make this statement and then enter into stillness and receptivity. Do not judge another today so that you may be happy.</p><p>今天，不要评判他人。每个小时都要提醒自己这一点，并简短地思考一下。在你的两次冥想练习中提醒自己这一点，在冥想练习中你会做出这样的声明，然后进入静心和接受状态。今天不要评判他人，这样你才会快乐。</p><p>Practice 82: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Strengthen your commitment to Knowledge. Do not fall into the apparent ease of self-deception. Do not be comfortable merely with assumptions or the beliefs of others. Do not accept generalities as truth. Do not accept appearances as representative of the reality of another. Do not accept the mere appearance of yourself. Doing these things demonstrates that you do not value yourself or your life and that you are too indolent to carry forth effort on your own behalf.</p><p>一小时后，练习说这句话，感受它的影响。加强你对内识的承诺。不要轻易陷入自欺。不要仅仅满足于假设或他人的信念。不要把泛泛之谈当作真理。不以表象代表他人的真实。不要只接受自己的表象。做这些事表明，你不重视自己或自己的生命，你太懒惰，无法为自己付出努力。</p><p>You must enter uncertainty to find Knowledge. What does this mean? It simply means you are giving up false assumptions, self-comforting ideas and the luxury of selfcondemnation. Why is self-condemnation a luxury? Because it is easy and does not require you to examine the truth. You accept it because it is acceptable in this world, and it gives you a great deal to talk about with your friends. It evokes sympathy. Therefore, it is easy and weak.</p><p>你必须进入不确定性，才能找到内识。这意味着什么？简单地说，就是你要放弃错误的假设、自我安慰的想法和自我谴责的奢望。为什么自我谴责是一种奢侈？因为它很容易，不需要你去审视真理。你接受它是因为在这个世界上它是可以被接受的，而且它还能让你和朋友们有很多话题可以聊。它能唤起同情。因此，它既简单又脆弱。</p><p>Do not deceive yourself today. Allow yourself to examine the mystery and the truth of your life. Upon the hour today repeat today’s idea and feel what it means. Also today, in two longer practice periods, repeat the statement and then dedicate yourself to stillness and receptivity. By now, you are beginning to learn how to prepare yourself for stillness—using your breath, concentrating your mind, relinquishing thoughts and reminding yourself that you are worthy of such an effort. Remind yourself of the goal that you are attempting to reach. Do not deceive yourself today. Do not give in to what is easy and painful.</p><p>今天，不要欺骗自己。让自己审视生命的神秘和真理。今天的每一小时，重复今天的想法，感受它的含义。同样在今天，在两个较长的练习时间里，重复这句话，然后专注于静心和接受。现在，你已经开始学习如何为静止做好准备——运用呼吸、集中精神、放弃杂念，并提醒自己，你值得付出这样的努力。提醒自己要达到的目标。今天不要欺骗自己。不要屈服于容易和痛苦的事物。</p><p>Practice 81: Two 30-minute practice periods.

Once again examine the qualities within yourself which aid you in your preparation and the qualities within yourself that make your preparation more difficult. Observe these things objectively. Learn to strengthen those aspects of yourself that encourage and strengthen your participation in the reclamation of Knowledge, and learn to adjust or correct those qualities that interfere. You must recognize both to have Wisdom.You must learn of truth and you must learn of error.You must do this to progress, and you must do this to serve others. Unless you have learned of error and can look at it objectively and understand how it has arisen and how it can be relieved—until you have learned these things—you will not know how to serve others, and their errors will anger you and frustrate you. With Knowledge your expectations will be in harmony with the nature of another.With Knowledge you will learn how to serve and you will forget how to condemn.</p><p>在今天的回顾中，再次回顾过去一周的练习和指导。再次审视自己身上哪些特质有助于你做好准备，哪些特质会使你的准备更加困难。客观地观察这些特质。学会加强自己那些鼓励和加强你参与内识的开垦的方面，学会调整或纠正那些干扰你的品质。你必须认识到这两点才能拥有智慧。你必须学习真理，也必须学习错误。你必须这样做才能进步，也必须这样做才能为他人服务。除非你认识到错误，并能客观地看待它，了解它是如何产生的，以及如何消除它——除非你学会了这些事情——否则你将不知道如何为他人服务，他们的错误会激怒你，让你感到沮丧。有了内识，你的期望就会与他人的本性和谐一致。有了内识，你就会学会如何服务，也会忘记如何谴责。</p><p>PRACTICE 77: One long practice period.</p><p>练习 77： 一个漫长的练习期</p>]]></content>

Each hour spend a minute not complaining about the world. Do not let the hours go by unattended, but be present for practice. Recognize the extent to which others are complaining about the world and how little it gives them and how little it gives the world.The world has already been condemned by those who dwell within it. If it is to be loved and cultivated, its predicaments must be recognized and its opportunities must be accepted.Who can complain when an environment is given where Knowledge can be reclaimed and contributed? The world only needs Knowledge and the expressions of Knowledge. How can it be worthy of condemnation?</p><p>今天的这一小时，请向自己发出这样的誓言，然后付诸实践。每小时花一分钟不抱怨世界。不要让时间白白流逝，而要亲身实践。认识到其他人对这个世界的抱怨程度，以及这个世界给他们和这个世界带来的是多么的微不足道。如果要爱它，培养它，就必须认识到它的困境，接受它的机会。如果有一个环境，内识可以被回收和贡献，谁还会抱怨呢？世界只需要内识和内识的表现形式。这怎么值得谴责呢？</p><p>PRACTICE 66: Hourly practice.</p><p>练习 66：每小时练习</p>]]></content>

As you come closer to freedom throughout the day, you will be able to recognize more and more clearly what holds you back. You will realize that it is but your adherence to your own thoughts that holds you back. It is your interest in your own imagination that holds you back. This will lighten your burden, and you will realize that a true choice is available. This realization will give you the strength to come to freedom today.</p><p>每小时重复今天的想法，花一点时间感受自由与你同在。随着你一天天接近自由，你会越来越清楚地认识到是什么阻碍了你。你会意识到，阻碍你的不过是你对自己想法的坚持。是你对自己想象力的兴趣阻碍了你。这将减轻你的负担，你将意识到真实的选择是存在的。这种认识会给你力量，让你今天就获得自由。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO DEEP MEDITATION PRACTICES, repeat today’s idea and attempt to allow your mind to be still, which is the beginning of its freedom. This practice in stillness will enable your mind to shake loose the chains that bind it—its unforgiveness from the past, its anxiety over the future and its avoidance of the present. In stillness, your mind rises above all that keeps it small, hidden and isolated within its own darkness. How close is freedom to you today who need but be still to receive it. And how great is your reward, you who have come into the world, for freedom is with you.</p><p>在你的两次深思练习中，重复今天的想法，并尝试让你的心灵静下来，这是它自由的开始。这种静止的练习会让你的心灵摆脱束缚它的枷锁——对过去的不原谅、对未来的焦虑和对现在的逃避。在静止中，你的心灵会超越一切使它渺小、隐藏和孤立于自身黑暗之中的束缚。今天，自由离你多么近，你只需静静地接受它。你来到这个世界，自由与你同在，你的奖赏何其丰厚。</p><p>PRACTICE 57: Two 30-minute practice periods.

It justifies blame and condemnation. It establishes expectations of a life that does not yet exist and thus renders you vulnerable to grave disappointment. Your idealism fortifies your condemnation.</p><p>理想主义就是试图不接受世界的现状。它为指责和谴责提供了理由。它使你对尚不存在的生活抱有期望，从而使你容易遭受严重的失望。你的理想主义强化了你的谴责。</p><p>ACCEPT THE WORLD TODAY AS IT IS, not as you want it to be. With acceptance comes love, for you cannot love a world that you want to exist. You can only love a world that exists as it is. Accept yourself now as you exist, and true desire for change and advancement will naturally emerge within you. Idealism justifies condemnation. Recognize this great truth, and you will begin to have a more immediate and profound experience of life and of that which is genuine and not based upon hope or expectation but upon true engagement.</p><p>接受当今世界的现状，而不是你想要的样子。接受就意味着爱，因为你无法爱一个你希望存在的世界。你只能爱一个如实存在的世界。接受你现在的存在，你内心自然会产生真实的改变和进步的愿望。理想主义是谴责的理由。认出这个伟大的真理，你就会开始对生活和真实的生命有更直接、更深刻的体验，这种体验不是基于希望或期待，而是基于真实的参与。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR TWO 30-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIODS today, concentrate on accepting things exactly as they are. You are not condoning violence, conflict or ignorance in doing this. You are merely accepting the conditions that exist so that you may work with them constructively. Without this acceptance, you have no starting place for true engagement. Allow the world to be exactly as it is, for it is this world that you have come to serve.</p><p>因此，在今天的两次30分钟练习中，集中精力接受事物的本来面目。这样做并不是纵容暴力、冲突或无知。你只是在接受现有的条件，以便建设性地处理它们。没有这种接受，你就没有真实参与的起点。让世界保持原样，因为你要服务的就是这个世界。</p><p>PRACTICE 55: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 55：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Your idealism includes yourself, your relationships and the world in which you live. It includes God and life and all realms of experience that you can imagine. Without experience, there is idealism. Idealism can be helpful at the beginning, for it can start you moving in a true direction, but you must not rest your conclusions or your identity upon it, for only experience can give you that which is true to you and that which you can fully accept. Let not idealism guide you, for Knowledge is here to guide you.</p><p>什么是理想主义，什么是基于失望而希望实现的理想？你的理想主义包括你自己、你的人际关系和你生活的世界。它包括上帝、生命以及你所能想象的所有经验领域。没有经历和体验，就没有理想主义。理想主义在开始时可能会有所帮助，因为它可以让你朝着真实的方向前进，但你绝不能将你的结论或你的身份建立在理想主义之上，因为只有经验才能给你真实适合你、你可以完全接受的身份。不要让理想主义指导你，因为内识就是来指导你的。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, recognize the extent of your own idealism. Observe carefully what you want yourself to be, what you want your world to be and what you want your relationships to be. Repeat today’s idea and, with eyes closed, examine each of your ideals. Even though your ideals may look beneficial and seem to represent your desire for love and harmony, they in effect hold you back, for they replace that which would truly give you the gifts that you seek.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，认识到自己理想主义的程度。仔细观察你希望自己成为什么样的人，你希望你的世界是什么样的，你希望你的人际关系是什么样的。重复今天的想法，闭上眼睛，审视你的每一个理想。即使你的理想看起来是有益的，似乎代表了你对爱与和谐的渴望，但它们实际上阻碍了你，因为它们取代了真正能给你带来你所追求的礼物的理想。</p><p>PRACTICE 54: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 54：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

How can you understand yourself except in the context of contribution to others? Alone you can do nothing. Alone you have no meaning. This is because you are not alone. This will be viewed as a burden and as a threat until you realize the great meaning that it has and the gift that it really is. It is the salvation of your life. When life reclaims you, you reclaim life and receive all of its rewards, which far exceed anything that you could give yourself. The value of your life is consummated and fully demonstrated through your contribution to others because until contribution exists, you can only partially realize yourself—your value, your purpose, your meaning and your direction.</p><p>你的礼物是用来给予他人的，但首先你必须认识到你的礼物，并将它们与束缚它们、改变它们或否定它们的观念区分开来。除了对他人的贡献，你如何才能了解自己？单独的你什么也做不了。单独的你没有意义。这是因为你并不孤独。这将被视为一种负担和威胁，直到你意识到它的伟大意义和它真正是一份礼物。它是你生命的救赎。当生命重新找回你时，你也就重新找回了生命，并获得了生命的所有回报，这些回报远远超过你自己所能给予的一切。你生命的价值是通过你对他人的贡献来完成和充分展示的，因为在贡献存在之前，你只能部分地实现你自己——你的价值、你的目的、你的意义和你的方向。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, feel your desire to contribute to others. You do not need now to determine what you wish to contribute. That is not as important as your desire to contribute, for the form of contribution will become evident to you in time and will evolve as well. It is your desire to contribute born of true motivation that will give you joy this day.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，感受你为他人做贡献的愿望。你现在不需要确定你想贡献什么。这并不重要，重要的是你想贡献的愿望，因为贡献的形式会随着时间的推移逐渐显现出来，并且也会不断发展。你的贡献愿望源于真实的动机，它将给你带来快乐。</p><p>PRACTICE 53: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 53：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

What other freedom is free except that which enables you to receive the gift of your true life? All other freedom is the freedom to be chaotic, the freedom to harm yourself. The great freedom is to find your Knowledge and to allow it to express itself through you. Today you are free to find the source of your Knowledge.</p><p>你的内识之源存在于你的内心，也在你的内心之外。内识之源不分存在于何处，因为它无处不在。你的生命之所以得到拯救，是因为上帝在你的内在植入了内识。但是，只有当内识被允许出现并赐予你它的礼物时，你才会意识到自己的救赎。除了能让你接受真实生命礼物的自由，还有什么其他自由呢？所有其他自由都是混乱的自由，是伤害自己的自由。伟大的自由是找到你的内识，并让它通过你表达自己。今天，你可以自由地找到你的内识之源。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS IN STILLNESS, receive the source of your Knowledge.

Close your eyes and repeat the idea for today; then consider each fear that arises in your mind. Remind yourself that the truth is beyond that specific fear. Allow all fears to arise and be evaluated in this way.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，评估你的恐惧是否存在，并提醒自己，你的现实是超越它们的，但你必须认出它们，以了解它们在你生命中的破坏性存在。闭上眼睛，重复今天的想法；然后思考脑海中出现的每一种恐惧。提醒自己，真理超越了特定的恐惧。允许所有恐惧出现，并以这种方式进行评估。</p><p>TO BE WITHOUT FEAR, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND FEAR—its mechanism, its influence on people and its result in the world. You must recognize this without deception and without preference. You are a great being working in a limited context, in a limited environment.

This may require several longer practice periods, but it is quite essential for you to gain a comprehension of what it means to be a student and how learning is actually accomplished.</p><p>这是完成第七周练习的标志。在这次复习中，要求你回顾所有七周的练习，复习所有说明，并回忆使用每项说明的经验。这可能需要几个较长的练习时间，但这对你理解学生的含义和学习的实际完成方式是非常重要的。</p><p>BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO JUDGE YOURSELF AS A STUDENT. You are not in a position to judge yourself as a student. You do not have the criteria, for you are not a teacher of Self Knowledge. You will find as you proceed that some of your failures will lead to greater successes, and that some of what you thought of as successes may lead to failures. This will underscore your whole system of evaluation and will lead you to a greater recognition. This will make it possible for you to be compassionate towards yourself and towards others whom you now judge for their successes and their failures.</p><p>不要把自己当作学生来评判。你没有资格把自己当作学生来评判。你没有标准，因为你不是内识的老师。你会发现，你的一些失败会带来更大的成功，而你认为的一些成功可能会导致失败。这将强调你的整个评估系统，并将引导你获得更多的承认。这将使你有可能对自己和他人怀有同情心，你现在对他们的成功和失败作出评价。</p><p>REVIEW, THEN, THE FIRST FORTY-EIGHT LESSONS OF PRACTICE. Try to recall how you responded to each step and how deeply you involved yourself. Try to look at your successes, your accomplishments and your obstacles. You have come this far. Congratulations!

It has been waiting for you to reach the point of maturity where you realize its necessity in your life. This engenders true motivation for learning. It is born of recognizing your limitations in light of that which is your true need. You must love yourself to become a student of Knowledge and continually love yourself to proceed. There is no other obstacle to learning but this. Without love there is fear, for nothing else can replace love. But love has not been replaced, and true assistance is available to you.</p><p>真实的指导是可用的。它一直在等待你达到成熟的地步，让你意识到它在你生命中的必要性。这才是真实的学习动力。这是因为你认识到了自己的局限性，而这才是你真实的需要。你必须爱自己，才能成为内识的学生，并不断爱自己，才能继续学习。除了这一点，学习没有其他障碍。没有爱就会有恐惧，因为没有任何恐惧可以取代爱。但是，爱并没有被取代，你可以得到真实的帮助。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO MEDITATION PRACTICES TODAY, attempt to feel the presence of that true assistance. In stillness and in silence, feel this within your life and around you. These meditation practices will begin to open a greater sensitivity within you, a whole new sense. You will begin to discern things that are present, even though you cannot see them. You will be able to respond to ideas and information, even though you cannot hear the source of the message yet. This is the actual process in creative thinking, for people receive ideas; they do not create them. You are part of a greater life. Your personal life is the vehicle for its expression. Your individuality, then, becomes more highly cultivated and more joyful, a prison no longer for you, but the form of your joyful expression.</p><p>在今天的两次冥想练习中，尝试感受真实的帮助存在。在静止和沉默中，在你的生命和周围感受到这一点。这些冥想练习将开启你内心更敏锐的触觉，一种全新的感觉。你将开始辨别那些不可见的存在，即使你看不见它们。你将能够对想法和信息做出回应，尽管你还听不到信息的来源。这就是创造性思维的实际过程，因为人们是接受想法，而不是创造想法。你是更伟大生命的一部分。你的个人生活是其表达的载体。这样，你的个性就会变得更有修养、更快乐，不再是你的牢笼，而是你快乐表达的形式。</p><p>TRUE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO YOU. Practice this day feeling its abiding presence in your life.</p><p>你可以获得真实的帮助。每天练习，感受它在你生命中的持久存在。</p><p>PRACTICE 48: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 48：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It is born of your  expectations of yourself that you would ask this question. Yet when you look carefully at your life, you will see that you have required instruction for everything that you have learned. Perhaps things that you felt inside yourself appeared to be created by you, but they, too, are the result of instruction. You have been prepared through relationships for everything that you have learned, whether it be a practical skill or a deeper insight. To realize this engenders great appreciation for relationships and a full affirmation of the power of contribution in the world.</p><p>你迟早会问这个问题，也许会问很多次。你会问这个问题，是因为你对自己抱有期望。然而，当你仔细回顾自己的一生时，你会发现你所学到的一切都需要指导。也许你内心感受到的想法似乎是你自己创造的，但它们也是指导的结果。你所学到的一切，无论是实用的技能还是更深刻的见解，都是通过关系准备好的。认识到这一点，就会对关系产生极大的感激之情，并充分肯定自己在世界上所做贡献的力量。</p><p>IF YOU WERE INTENDING TO HONESTLY APPROACH LEARNING any skill, first you must recognize how much you do not know, then you must recognize how much you need to learn, and then you must seek the best form of instruction possible. This must apply to the reclamation of Knowledge. You must realize how little you know, how much you need to know and then receive the instruction that is provided. Is it a weakness to need a teacher? No. It is an honest recognition based upon an honest evaluation. If you realize how little you know and how much you need to know and the power of Knowledge itself, you will understand how obvious this is. How can you give to those who think they already have, when in reality they are poor? You cannot. And their poverty will be self-inflicted and self-maintained.</p><p>如果你想真诚地学习任何技能，首先你必须认识到你不知道的技能有多少，然后你必须认识到你需要学习的技能有多少，然后你必须尽可能寻求最好的指导方式。这必须适用于内识的开垦。你必须认识到自己知道的有多少，需要学习的有多少，然后接受所提供的指导。需要老师是一种弱点吗？不，这是一种基于诚实评估的诚实认识。如果你意识到自己知道的有多么少，需要知道的有多么多，以及内识本身的力量，你就会明白这一点有多么明显。对于那些自以为已经拥有而实际上却很贫穷的人，你怎么能给予他们帮助呢？你做不到。他们的贫穷是自己造成的，也是自己维持的。</p><p>WHY DO YOU NEED A TEACHER? Because you need to learn. And you need to unlearn that which you have learned that is holding you back. In your two practice periods today, with your eyes closed in meditation, consider why you need a Teacher. Observe any thoughts that seem to indicate that you could do it on your own if you were smart enough or strong enough or met some other qualification. If these expectations arise, recognize them for what they are. They are an insistence that you remain ignorant by proclaiming yourself an adequate instructor. You cannot teach yourself what you do not know, and the attempt to do so merely recirculates old information and binds you closer to where you are now.</p><p>为什么需要老师？因为你需要学习。你需要解除那些阻碍你学习的想法。在今天的两次练习中，闭目冥想，思考你为什么需要老师。观察是否有任何想法似乎表明，如果你足够聪明、足够强大或符合其他一些条件，你就可以自己做到。如果出现这些期望，请认清它们的本质。它们是在坚持要求你继续保持无知，宣称自己是一个足够的指导者。你不可能教自己不知道的东西，而试图这样做只会重复旧的信息，使你更接近现在的状态。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN PRACTICE TODAY RECOGNIZE your need for true instruction and your resistance, if it is there, to the presence of true instruction which is available to you now.</p><p>因此，在今天的练习中，认识到你对真实指导的需求，以及你对真实指导的抗拒（如果有的话）。</p><p>PRACTICE 47: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 47：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It is not a contradiction if you understand its meaning. Recognizing your limitations allows you to work in a limited context very successfully. This demonstrates a greater reality than you could have realized before. Your greatness must not be based merely on hope or high expectation. It must not be founded on idealism but on true experience. Allow yourself to be small, and you will experience that greatness is with you and that greatness is part of you.</p><p>你必须渺小才能伟大，这是否矛盾？如果你理解它的含义，就不会觉得矛盾。认识到自己的局限性，你就能在有限的环境中非常成功地工作。这证明了一个比你以前所能意识到的更大的现实。你的伟大不能仅仅建立在希望或殷切期望之上。它不能建立在理想主义之上，而应建立在真实的经验之上。允许自己渺小，你就会体验到伟大与你同在，伟大是你的一部分。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, allow yourself to be limited but without judgment. There is no condemnation. Actively engage your mind in focusing on your limitations. Focus without condemnation. Look objectively. You are meant to be a vehicle for a Greater Reality to express itself in this world. Your vehicle for expression is quite limited, but it is fully adequate to accomplish the task that is yours to accomplish. In accepting its limitations, you can understand its mechanism and learn to work with it constructively. Then it is no longer a limitation but a form of joyful expression for you.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，允许自己受到限制，但不带评判。没有谴责。积极调动你的思维，关注自己的局限性。专注而不谴责。客观地看待问题。你本应是更大现实在这个世界上表达的载体。你的表达载体非常有限，但它完全足以完成你要完成的任务。接受它的局限性，你就能理解它的机制，学会建设性地与它合作。这样，它就不再是一种限制，而是你快乐表达的一种形式。</p><p>PRACTICE 46: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 46：两个 15 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Nothing has ever been accomplished alone, even in your world. Nothing has ever been created alone, even in your mind. There is no credit to be received by doing something alone. Everything is a joint effort. Everything is the product of relationship.</p><p>你一个人什么也做不了。没有什么能独自完成，即使在你的世界里。没有任何事物是独自创造的，即使是在你的脑海中。单枪匹马是无法取得任何成就的。一切都是共同努力的结果。一切都是关系的产物。</p><p>DOES THIS DEMEAN YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL? Most certainly not. It gives you the environment and the understanding to realize your true accomplishments. You are greater than your individuality, and thus you may be free of its limitations. You work through the individual that is you personally, but you are greater than this. Accept the limitations of a limited self, and do not require a limited self to be God or you will give it great burdens and great expectations and will then punish it for its failures. This leads to self-hatred. This leads you to resent your physical life and to abuse yourself personally, emotionally and physically. Accept your limitations so that you may accept greatness within your life.</p><p>这并不是贬低你作为一个个体。它为你提供了环境和理解，让你意识到自己真实的成就。你远远超越了个体的局限性，因此你可以摆脱这些限制。你通过个人的方式工作，但你远比个体更伟大。接受有限自我的局限性，不要期望有限的自我成为上帝，否则你会给它巨大的负担和巨大的期望，然后因为它的失败而惩罚它。这会导致自我厌恶。这会让你对自己的生命产生怨恨，并对自己进行人身、情感和身体上的虐待。接受自己的局限性，这样你就可以接受生命中的伟大。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, with your eyes open, concentrate now on your limitations. Recognize them. Do not judge them as good or bad. Simply recognize them. This gives you humility, and in humility you are in a position to receive greatness. If you are defending your limitations, how can you receive that which transcends them?</p><p>因此，在今天的两次练习中，睁大你的眼睛，集中精力关注你的局限性。承认它们。不要评判它们的好坏。只需承认它们。这让你变得谦逊，而在谦逊中，你才能获得伟大。如果你为自己的局限性辩护，你怎么能接受局限性之外的关系呢？</p><p>PRACTICE 45: Two 15-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习 45：两个 15 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You have far more strength than you have claimed, but it cannot be fully realized until its application is directed in a manner that truly regenerates you and brings forth your true abilities.</p><p>由于你在当前情况下的迫切需要，你可能会非常接受这一肯定，但这一肯定远比你一开始意识到的要深刻得多。你所拥有的力量远比你所宣称的要大得多，但只有以真正使你再生并发挥你真实能力的方式来运用它，你才能充分认识到这一点。</p><p>HOW CAN YOU APPROACH YOUR STRENGTH when you feel weak and helpless, when you feel unworthy, if you are burdened by guilt or confusion or in anger blame others for your own apparent failures? To claim your strength means to release all that holds you back. You do not release your obstacles by claiming they do not exist. You release them because you value something greater. Their obstruction is merely the sign that you must pass through them. Your own strength is then cultivated. You seek your strength, and you use it to find your strength. We wish for you to know your strength and to utilize it on your own behalf.</p><p>当你感到软弱和无助时，当你感到不值得时，当你被负罪感或困惑所累时，当你愤怒地将自己的明显失败归咎于他人时，你如何能够接近你的力量呢？宣示你的力量意味着释放所有阻碍你的障碍。你不会因为声称障碍不存在而释放它们。你释放它们是因为你珍视更大的力量。它们的阻碍只是你必须通过它们的标志。这样，你自己的力量就得到了培养。你寻找自己的力量，并用内识来找到自己的力量。我们希望你知道自己的力量，并为自己所用。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO MEDITATION PRACTICES TODAY, in silence and in stillness, attempt to feel your own strength. Do not let thoughts alone dissuade you, for fears and doubts are only thoughts—vaporous things that cross your mind like clouds. Beyond the clouds of your mind is the great universe of Knowledge. Therefore, do not let the clouds obstruct your view of the stars beyond.</p><p>在今天的两次冥想练习中，在静默和寂静中，尝试感受自己的力量。不要让杂念打消你的念头，因为恐惧和疑虑只是杂念——像云朵一样在你脑海中飘过的虚无缥缈的想法。在你思想的云层之外，是伟大的内识宇宙。因此，不要让乌云遮挡你的视线，让你看到外面的星空。</p><p>PRACTICE 44: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 44：两个 30 分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

That is your true will. Any other desire or motivation is to escape this, which  represents your will. It is your will that has become fearful to you. You are afraid of what you know and most deeply feel. This leads you to find refuge in other things that do not represent you, and in this you lose your identity and attempt to construct an identity that is related to those things which you have sought for escape. In isolation you are miserable, but in relationship happiness is regained.</p><p>你的意愿是知道上帝。那是你真实的意愿。任何其他欲望或动机都是为了逃避这一点，这代表了你的意志。你害怕你所知道和最深刻感受到的意愿。这导致你寻求在其他事物中寻找避难所，这些事物并不代表你，通过这样做，你失去了自我身份，并试图建立一个与你寻求逃避的事物相关的身份。在孤独中，你是可怜的，但在关系中，幸福重新获得。</p><p>YOUR WILL IS TO KNOW GOD. Do not be afraid of your will. You are created by God. God’s will is to know you. Your will is to know God. There is no other will. All motivations other than this are born merely of confusion and fear. To know God gives God power and gives you power as well.</p><p>你的意愿是知道上帝。不要害怕你的意愿。你是由上帝创造的。上帝的意愿是知道你。你的意愿是知道上帝。没有其他意愿。除此之外的所有动机都只是混乱和恐惧所生。通过知道上帝的力量，来给予你力量。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, in silent meditation, practice feeling the strength of your own will. Do not let fear and doubt cloud your mind. You need not try to feel the will of God. It is simply there. It only requires your attention for you to recognize it. Therefore, practice deeply by simply being present to this experience.</p><p>在今天的两个实践时段中，在静默的冥想中，练习感受你自己意愿的力量。不要让恐惧和怀疑混淆你的心。你不需要努力去感受上帝的意愿。它就在那里。你只需要注意到它就可以了。因此，通过简单地存在于这种体验中，深入练习。</p><p>PRACTICE 43: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习43：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Take special care today to see how deeply and how carefully you are practicing. Make sure that you are not changing or adjusting the lessons to meet your tastes or expectations. Remember that you need only follow the curriculum to receive its true rewards. Your part is small. Our part is great. We give the means. You need only follow them, in faith and in true expectation. In doing this, you will develop patience, discernment, trust, consistency and self-worth. Why self-worth? Because you must value yourself highly to allow yourself to approach the great gifts of Knowledge. Nothing else will undo self-hatred and self-doubt more expediently and more completely than receiving the gifts that are meant for you.</p><p>在今天的回顾中，审视过去一周所给出的所有指导以及你的实践经验。特别注意今天你练习的深度和仔细程度。确保你没有改变或调整课程以满足你的口味或期望。记住，你只需要遵循课程以获得真正的回报。你的作用很小。我们的作用很大。我们提供手段。你只需信心满满地跟随它们。通过这样做，你将培养出耐心、洞察力、信任、一致性和自我价值感。为什么要自我价值感？因为你必须高度重视自己，才能让自己接近属于你的伟大礼物。没有任何事情比接收那些为你准备的礼物更快地、更彻底地解除自我厌恶和自我怀疑。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR ONE LONG PRACTICE PERIOD TODAY, review the past week of practice. Without judgment, look and see what has been offered, what you have done and what can possibly be done to deepen your practice so that you may receive its benefits more directly. If you are having difficulty, recognize the problems and attempt to correct them. Give the week ahead greater involvement. In doing so, you will correct self-doubt and confusion merely by directing your will.</p><p>因此，在今天的一个长时间练习期间，回顾过去一周的练习。不带评判地看看已经提供了什么，你做了什么，以及可能做些什么来加深你的练习，使你能够更直接地获得其益处。如果你遇到困难，认识到问题并尝试加以纠正。让未来一周更加投入。通过这样做，你将通过引导自己的意志纠正自我怀疑和困惑。</p><p>PRACTICE 42: One long practice period.</p><p>练习42：一个长时间的练习期</p>]]></content>

For this, you must relinquish your former ideas, assumptions and evaluations of past painful experiences. It is painful to be separated from that which you love beyond all things, and the only way to maintain this separation is to malign that which you love, to give it an evil intent and then to engender guilt within yourself. To feel and accept the power of God, evil and guilt must leave you. You must venture forth to explore that which is most natural. It is like breaking new ground and coming home all at once.</p><p>这个肯定句对你的幸福非常重要，因为你必须再次学会信任爱的力量和上帝的力量。为此，你必须放弃你过去的想法、假设和对过去痛苦经历的评价。被与你最深爱的上帝分离是痛苦的，而保持这种分离的唯一方法就是诋毁你所爱的上帝，给它一个邪恶的意图，然后在你内心产生罪恶感。要感受和接受上帝的力量，邪恶和罪恶必须离开你。你必须勇于探索那些最自然的力量。这就像开辟新天地并一次回到家。</p><p>IN STILLNESS, THEN, PRACTICE TWICE TODAY feeling the power of God. Do not seek for answers from God. You need not speak at all but only be present, for as you learn to be in relationship with that which is the source of all your relationships, the information that you need can come easily to you to guide you, comfort you and correct you when necessary. But first you must feel the power of God, and in this you will find your own strength.</p><p>因此，在安静中，今天练习两次感受上帝的力量。不要从上帝那里寻求答案。你根本不需要说话，只需要在那里存在，因为当你学会与一切关系的源头建立关系时，你所需要的信息可以轻松地来到你这里，指导你、安慰你，并在必要时纠正你。但首先，你必须感受上帝的力量，在这里你会找到自己的力量。</p><p>PRACTICE 41: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习41：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

How can you know certainty when you value the temporary so greatly? How can you know the power of your own life when you are so intimidated by threats of loss and destruction? Life is kind to you, for it offers not only the reward but the way to the reward. If it were left up to you, it would be cruel indeed, for you would have to attempt every single possibility that you could conceive of, and then you would have the possibilities that others have conceived of and even the opportunities to reach Knowledge that others have used successfully but which may not in fact work well for you. In your brief span of time in the world, how can you accomplish all of these and still maintain your vitality? How can you maintain your encouragement for Knowledge when so many ways will disappoint you?</p><p>当你迷失时，你如何找到自己的路？当你如此看重暂时的事物时，你如何确定？当你如此被损失和毁灭的威胁所吓倒时，你如何知道自己生命的力量？生命对你很仁慈，因为它不仅提供了奖励，还提供了通往奖励的途径。如果一切都交给你来决定，那将是残酷的，因为你将不得不尝试你能想象到的每一个可能性，然后你将有其他人构想的可能性，甚至有机会获得他人成功使用过但实际上对你来说可能不太适用的通往内识的途径。当你还在世界上的短暂时间里，你如何完成所有这些，并仍然保持你的活力？当有那么多的方式会让你失望时，你如何保持对内识的鼓励？</p><p>TAKE FAITH TODAY IN KNOWING THAT GOD knows the way to Knowledge, and you need only follow the way that is being given. In this way, Knowledge simply emerges in you because it is acknowledged, for only God knows Knowledge in you, and only Knowledge in you knows God. As the two resonate together, they both become more apparent. In this, you find peace.</p><p>今天相信内识，因为上帝知道通往内识的路径，你只需要跟随正在给予的路径。通过这种方式，内识在你内在简单地出现，因为它被承认了，因为只有上帝知道你内在的内识，只有你内在的内识知道上帝。当两者共鸣时，它们都变得更加显现。在这种情况下，你会找到平静。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, each of a 30-minute duration, practice feeling the presence of God, silently, in stillness. Not thinking about God, not speculating, not wondering, not doubting, but simply feeling. It is no fantasy that you are concentrating upon now, though you are used to concentrating upon fantasy. In stillness and quiet, everything becomes apparent. God is very still, for God is not going anywhere. As you become still, you will feel the power of God.</p><p>在今天的两个练习时段中，每个时段持续30分钟，练习在寂静中感受上帝的存在。不是思考上帝，不是推测，不是好奇，不是怀疑，而是简单地感受。你现在专注的不是幻想，尽管你习惯于专注于幻想。在寂静和宁静中，一切都变得明显。上帝是非常静止的，因为上帝无处不在。当你变得静止时，你将感受到上帝的力量。</p><p>PRACTICE 38: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习38：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

How can there not be a way for Knowledge to express itself when it is the most natural form of expression? How can there not be a way for Knowledge to guide you in relationships when Knowledge is the perfect source of all your relationships? There is a way to Knowledge. It requires skill and desire. Both will take time to develop. You must learn to value the true and not to value the false, and it takes time to learn to separate the two and to recognize them. It takes time to learn that the false does not satisfy you and that the true does satisfy you. This must be learned through trial and error and through contrast. As you approach Knowledge, your life becomes more full, more certain and more direct. As you go away from it, you re-enter confusion, frustration and anger.</p><p>当内识就是你的真实自我时，怎么会没有通往内识的途径呢？内识是最自然的表达方式，怎么会没有表达方式呢？内识是你所有关系的完美来源，怎么会没有办法让内识在人际关系中指导你呢？通往内识的道路是存在的。它需要技能和渴望。两者都需要时间来培养。你必须学会珍视真实而非虚假，学会将两者区分开来并识别它们需要时间。要学会虚假不能满足你，真实才能满足你，这需要时间。这必须通过反复试验和对比才能学会。当你接近内识时，你的生命会变得更加充实、更加确定、更加直接。当你远离它时，你会重新陷入困惑、沮丧和愤怒。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, which will not be meditation practices, spend at least 15 minutes thinking of all the ways to gain access to Knowledge. Write down on a piece of paper all the ways to get to Knowledge. Spend both practice periods doing this and exhaust all the possibilities that you can think of. Try to be very specific. Use your imagination, but chart out routes that appear to be quite real and meaningful to you. In this way, you will know what you think about how to find a way to Knowledge, and from this you will realize that God knows the way to Knowledge.</p><p>在今天的两次练习（不是冥想练习）中，至少花15分钟思考获得内识的所有方法。在纸上写下获得内识的所有方法。两个练习时段都这样做，穷尽你能想到的所有可能性。尽量具体。发挥你的想象力，但要描绘出对你来说相当真实和有意义的路线。这样，你就会知道自己对如何找到通往内识之路的看法，并由此认识到上帝知道通往内识的道路。</p><p>PRACTICE 37: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习 36 ：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This is essential for your happiness and fulfillment in the world, for if you have been looking carefully at your life, you will realize you have not been satisfied by little things. For you who seek Knowledge, something greater must be given. You must penetrate the mere surface of things, which seems to adequately stimulate most people. You must accept your deeper yearning or you will cause yourself unnecessary grief and conflict. It is not important what other people value. It is important what you value. If you are seeking for greater meaning, which is true meaning, you must penetrate the surface of your mind.</p><p>确实，你的生命是一个谜，如果你希望理解其目的、其意义和真实的方向，你需要探索它。这对你在世界上的幸福和满足至关重要，因为如果你仔细观察你的生活，你会意识到小事并不能满足你。对于寻求内识的你，必须给予更大的满足。你必须穿透生活的表面，这表面似乎足以刺激大多数人。你必须接受你更深的渴望，否则你将给自己带来不必要的痛苦和冲突。他人重视什么并不重要。重要的是你重视什么。如果你在寻求更大的意义，即真实的意义，你必须穿透你心智的表面。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, again concentrate in meditation upon feeling the presence of your Spiritual Teachers. This is not something you have to try to do. It simply means relaxing, breathing and allowing your mind to open. The quality of your relationship with your Teachers is essential to give you strength and encouragement, for you may justly doubt your own skills, but you have good cause to fully trust the skills of your Teachers, who have passed this way before on their way to Knowledge. They know the way, which they are seeking now to share with you.</p><p>在今天的两次练习时期中，再次集中冥想，感受你精神老师的存在。这不是你必须尝试去做的事情。这仅仅意味着放松，呼吸并让你的心灵开放。你与导师的关系质量对于给予你力量和鼓励至关重要，因为你可能正当地怀疑自己的技能，但你完全有理由信任你老师的技能，他们之前已经走过这条路，现在正试图与你分享这条路。他们知道前行的道路。</p><p>PRACTICE 36: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习36：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="STEP-35-REVIEW"><a href="#STEP-35-REVIEW" class="headerlink" title="STEP 35  REVIEW"></a>STEP 35  REVIEW</h2><p>THIS REVIEW WILL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY to learn something of The Greater Community Way of Knowledge. In two 30-minute practice periods, review your prior week’s instructions and experiences in practice. Do this with as little judgment as possible. Merely look and see what was instructed, what you did and what the result was. This objective review will give you the greatest access to insight and understanding with a minimum of pain and self-abuse. You are learning now to become objective about your life without repressing the content of your emotions. Instead of attempting to destroy one aspect of yourself, you are simply attempting to cultivate another.</p><p>这次回顾将为你提供一个机会，让你学习一些关于大社区内识之路的知识。在两个30分钟的练习时段中，回顾你前一周的指导和练习经验。尽可能少地进行评判，只是观察和了解被指导的内容、你所做的事以及结果如何。这种客观的回顾将以最小的痛苦和自我虐待，为你提供最大的洞察力和理解。你现在正在学习如何在不压抑情感内容的情况下，对自己的生活保持客观。你不是试图摧毁自己的某一方面，而是简单地尝试培养另一方面。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR REVIEW, use this as a guidepost: “I will look, but I will not judge.” In this way, you will be able to recognize things. Remember how much easier it may be for you to have insight about another’s life and how little you may have about your own. Greater objectivity is possible with others because you are not attempting to use their life for any specific purpose and the extent to which you are, the less able you will be to understand them, their nature, their development or their destiny. Therefore, the less you attempt to use your life, the more you will be able to understand it, appreciate it and work with its intrinsic mechanism for your greater advancement.</p><p>因此，在你的回顾中，使用这个指导原则：“我会观察，但我不会评判。”通过这种方式，你将能够认识到事物。请记住，对别人的生活有洞察力对你来说可能会更容易，而你对自己的生命却知之甚少。由于你不是出于任何特定目的利用他们的生命，你对他人的客观性可能更强，而你越是这样做，你就越难理解他们、他们的本质、他们的发展或他们的命运。因此，你越少试图利用自己的生命，你就越能理解它、欣赏它，并与其内在机制合作，以促进你更大的进步。</p><p>PRACTICE 35: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习35：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Regardless of how intuitive you may consider yourself,  regardless of how mentally capable you may consider yourself, regardless of how emotionally honest you may consider yourself, no matter what your recognized advancement, you are a beginning student of Knowledge. Be happy that this is so, for beginning students are in a position to learn all things and need not defend their accomplishments. We do not belittle your accomplishments but instead wish to shine the light of truth upon the greatness that waits to be discovered within you, a greatness that will give you true equality in life and in time will reveal what you have come here specifically to do.</p><p>你是一名内识的初学者。无论你认为自己的直觉如何，无论你认为自己的心理能力如何，无论你认为自己在情感上如何诚实，无论你认识的进步程度如何，你都是内识的初级学生。要为这一点感到高兴，因为初学的学生有能力学习所有的课程，不需要为他们的成就辩护。我们不是在贬低你的成就，而是希望在你内在的伟大上照亮真理的光芒，这种伟大将给你真实的平等，并将随着时间的推移揭示你特别来这里要做的事情。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS, begin by acknowledging to yourself that you are a beginning student of Knowledge and by reminding yourself to make no premature conclusions either about this curriculum or about your abilities as a student. Such judgments are premature and rarely reflect the truth in any way. They are usually a form of self-discouragement and thus serve no worthy purpose at all.</p><p>在你的两个练习时段中，首先承认你是内识的初学者，并提醒自己不要对这个课程或你作为学生的能力做出过早的结论。这样的判断是不成熟的，很少以任何方式反映真理。它们通常是一种自我打击的形式，因此根本没有任何值得的目的。</p><p>AFTER DECLARING TODAY’S IDEA TO YOURSELF and reminding yourself not to judge, practice 15 minutes of inner stillness in your two practice periods. Attempt to feel the truth within you. Focus your mind on one point, either a physical point or an imaginary point if necessary. Let everything settle down inside. Let yourself become as quiet as possible, and do not be discouraged if there is difficulty. You are a beginning student of Knowledge and thus can learn all things.</p><p>在向自己宣告今天的想法并提醒自己不要评判之后，在你的两个练习时段中练习15分钟的内心静止。尝试感受你内在的真理。将你的注意力集中在一个点上，无论是物理点还是必要时的想象点。让内心的一切都平静下来。尽可能让自己变得安静，如果有困难，不要气馁。你是内识的初学者，因此可以学习所有事物。</p><p>PRACTICE 34: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习34：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It involves the reclamation of Knowledge and the proper engagement with others to bring about specific results in the world. It is not so important at this moment that you evaluate your current life to see if it reflects this greater purpose, for you are now involved in the reclamation of Knowledge. As your Knowledge becomes stronger, it will shine its beneficence upon you and through you. Your activities will then be adjusted as is necessary. Thus, you need not blame or condone the past or your current activities, for you are now adhering to a greater strength within you.</p><p>你的生活中有一个需要完成的使命，这是你来到这里之前就给予你的使命，也是你离开后将会回顾的使命。它涉及到内识的回收以及与他人的适当互动，以在世界上带来特定的结果。此时此刻，重要的不是评估你当前的生活是否反映了这个更大的目的，因为你现在正在参与内识的重新开垦。随着你的内识变得更加强大，它将在你身上并通过你照耀它的益处。然后你的活动将根据需要进行调整。因此，你不需要责备或宽恕过去或你目前的活动，因为你现在正坚持依靠你内在的更大力量。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO LONG PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, dwell upon the idea that there is a great mission that you have in life. Think about this. Do not become immediately convinced by your own first responses. Think about it carefully. Think what this could mean. Think of the moments in your life when you have thought of this before or have entertained its possibility. In your two practice periods, you will have an opportunity then to consider this, but beware—make no conclusions yet.</p><p>在今天的两个长时间练习时段中，思考你在生活中拥有一个伟大使命的想法。仔细思考这一点。不要立即被你的第一反应所说服。仔细思考它可能意味着什么。回想你生活中曾经思考过这个问题或曾经考虑过这种可能性的时刻。在你的两个练习时段中，你将有机会考虑这个问题，但要注意——暂时不要做出结论。</p><p>PRACTICE 33: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习33：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Use your breath to take you deeper, for your breathing will always take you beyond your thoughts if you adhere yourself to it conscientiously. Let nothing distract or dissuade you. If something permeates your mind and you have difficulty releasing it, tell yourself that you will look at it a little later, but that right now you are taking a small vacation from your mind. Practice feeling the truth. Do not think the truth. Practice feeling the truth.</p><p>在你的两个较长的练习时段中，每次持续30分钟，静静地坐着，闭上眼睛，深呼吸并保持规律，尝试感受你心灵不断动荡之外的真理。使用你的呼吸带你更深入，因为如果你认真地坚持使用呼吸，它总是能带你超越你的思维。不要让任何想法分散你的注意力或劝阻你。如果有什么事情充斥你的思绪并且你难以释放，告诉自己你稍后会看它，但现在你正在从你的思绪中短暂休假。练习感受真理。不要思考真理。练习感受真理。</p><p>PRACTICE 32: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习32：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

To develop this quality of self-observation, you must be as free of judgment as possible, for judgment disables you from being observant. You must study yourself as if you were someone else with whom you can be far more objective.</p><p>在这个特殊的练习日，全天观察自己，尽可能地保持对自己思想和行为的觉察。为了发展这种自我观察的品质，你必须尽可能地不做判断，因为判断使你无法观察。你必须研究你自己，就好像你是别人，这样你才能更客观地看待自己。</p><p>WE SHALL PRACTICE ON THE HOUR TODAY. Each hour you will need to check in to see your thoughts and to observe your current behavior. This constant self-checking will enable you to become far more involved in your current experience and will allow your Knowledge to exercise its beneficial influence upon you to a far greater degree. Knowledge knows what you need and knows how to serve you, but you must learn how to receive. In time, you must learn how to give as well so that you may receive more. Your receiving is important because it enables you to give, and giving is the essence of fulfillment in this world. But you cannot give from an impoverished state. Therefore, your giving must be genuine, born of the overflowing receptivity that you have cultivated within yourself, within your relationships with others and with life.</p><p>我们将在今天每小时进行练习。每个小时你都需要检查自己的思想并观察自己当前的行为。这种持续的自我检查将使你能够更深入地参与到当前的经历中，并将允许你的内识更大程度地发挥其有益的影响。内识知道你需要什么并知道如何为你服务，但你必须学会如何接受。随着时间的推移，你也必须学会如何给予，以便你能接受更多。你的接受很重要，因为它使你能够给予，而给予是在这个世界上实现自我满足的本质。但是，你不能从一个贫瘠的状态给予。因此，你的给予必须是真诚的，源于你内心溢出的接受能力，在你与他人和生命的关系中培养出来。</p><p>EACH PRACTICE PERIOD NEED ONLY TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES but should be given your full attention. You need not close your eyes to do this, though if it is appropriate, it will be helpful. You may practice in the middle of a conversation with another. In fact, there are very few circumstances that will prevent this moment of introspection. In practice you simply ask yourself, “How do I feel?” and “What am I doing now?” That is all. Then feel if there is something you must do that you are not doing. If there are no corrections to be made, continue on with what you are doing. If there are corrections to be made, make them as expediently as possible. Allow your inner guidance to influence you, which it will do if you are not governed by impulses, fear or ambition. Observe yourself this day.</p><p>每个实践时段只需要几分钟，但应该给予你的全部注意力。你不需要闭上眼睛来做这个，虽然如果合适的话，这将是有帮助的。你可以在与他人交谈的过程中进行实践。实际上，很少有情况会阻止这一时刻的内省。在实践中，你只需问自己：“我感觉怎么样？”和“我现在在做什么？”就是这样。然后感觉是否有你必须做而没有做的事情。如果没有需要纠正的地方，请继续你正在做的事情。如果有需要纠正的地方，请尽快进行纠正。让你的内在指导影响你，如果你不受冲动、恐惧或野心的支配，它将这样做。今天观察自身。</p><p>PRACTICE 29: Hourly practice.</p><p>练习29：每小时练习</p>]]></content>

I accept my Teachers as my elder brothers and sisters. I accept my world as a place where Knowledge can be reclaimed and contributed. I accept my past as a demonstration of life without Knowledge. I accept the miracles of my life as a demonstration of the presence of Knowledge, and I give myself now to cultivate that which is of the greatest good within myself to be given to the world.”</p><p>“我接受我的内识作为上帝的礼物。我接受我的老师们作为我的兄长姐妹。我接受我的世界作为一个可以重新获得和贡献内识的地方。我接受我的过去作为一个没有内识的生命展示。我接受我生命中的奇迹作为内识存在的展示，并且我现在将培养我内在的至善，以便将其贡献给世界。”</p><p>ONCE AGAIN WE SHALL REVIEW THE PAST WEEK OF PRACTICE, rereading all of the instructions and with each step reviewing what has transpired in your times of practice. Be sure to ask yourself how deeply you were involved in practice—how much you wanted to search and investigate, how carefully you examined your own experience and to what extent you felt motivated to penetrate whatever barriers that might exist.</p><p>我们将再次回顾过去一周的练习，重新阅读所有的指导，并且在每一个步骤中回顾在你的练习时间里发生了什么。务必问自己你在练习中的参与程度有多深——你有多么想要探索和调查，你多仔细地检查了自己的经历，以及你在多大程度上感觉有动力去突破可能存在的障碍。</p><p>OUR ONE 45-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIOD OF REVIEW WILL begin to give you a perspective on your development in this preparation. This is beneficial not only for yourself but for those whom you will serve in the future, for as you are receiving now, you will wish to give in whatever context and in whatever form is appropriate for you. You must understand how people learn and how people develop. This must come from your own experience and must represent the love and compassion that are the natural emanations of your Knowledge. Again do not let any doubt or confusion dissuade you from your true application.</p><p>我们的一次45分钟的练习回顾期将开始给你一个关于你在这个准备中的发展的视角。这不仅对你自己有益，也对那些将来你将服务的人有益，因为你现在正如你希望在任何情境和任何形式中给予的那样接受。你必须理解人们如何学习和如何发展。这必须来自你自己的经验，并且必须代表你的内识自然散发的爱与慈悲。再次，不要让任何疑惑或混乱劝阻你真实的应用。</p><p>PRACTICE 28: One 45-minute practice period.</p><p>练习28：一个45分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

If you are not feeling this, it means that you are entertaining something that is false and without true foundation in your being. If you have ever felt that the truth betrayed you, then you have not recognized its value. Perhaps it disappointed your plans and goals. Perhaps you lost something you really wanted. Perhaps it prevented you from seeking something that was desirable. But in all cases it has saved you from pain and misery. Until your true function has been recognized, you cannot appreciate how the truth has served you, for until your function is discovered, you will attempt to claim and justify other functions. If these other functions are discouraged or denied by the truth, there can be great confusion and conflict. Yet remember that the truth has always saved you from a greater error that you would have committed otherwise.</p><p>这个肯定表达了你的真实意愿。如果你没有这种感觉，那说明你正在容纳一些虚假的、在你的存在中没有真实基础的关系。如果你曾经觉得真理背叛了你，那是因为你没有认识到它的价值。也许它让你的计划和目标受挫，也许你失去了某个你真正想要的关系，也许它阻止了你追求某个渴望的事物。但在所有情况下，它都救你脱离了痛苦和悲惨。在你的真实职能被认识到之前，你无法体会到真理对你的帮助，因为在你发现自己的职能之前，你会试图追求并证明其他职能的合理性。如果这些其他职能被真理否决或打压，会引发极大的困惑和冲突。然而，请记住，真理总是会拯救你免于犯下更大的错误。</p><p>PEOPLE CANNOT EXPERIENCE KNOWLEDGE because they are preoccupied with thoughts and judgments. These thoughts and judgments create a self-enclosed world for an individual, a selfenclosed world where they cannot see out. They can only see the content of their thoughts and this colors their experience of life entirely, so much so that they cannot see life at all.</p><p>人们无法体验到内识，因为他们专注于思维和判断。这些思维和判断为个人创造了一个自我封闭的世界，在这个自我封闭的世界中，他们无法看到外面的世界。他们只能看到自己的思维内容，而这些内容完全影响了他们对生命的体验，以至于他们根本看不到生命。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR TWO 30-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIODS, look and see how the truth has served you. Look at experiences that were happy. Look at experiences that were painful. Particularly in painful experiences, look at how the truth has served you. Look openly. Do not defend a former position if you are tempted to do so. If pain still exists from a loss of an earlier time, accept that pain and its discouragement, but try to look and see how you were truly served by that loss.</p><p>因此，在两次30分钟的练习中，看看真理是如何帮助你的。看看那些快乐的经历，也看看那些痛苦的经历。尤其是在痛苦的经历中，看看真理是如何帮助你的。开放地看，不要去捍卫过去的立场，即使你被诱惑去这样做。如果过去的损失仍然让你痛苦，接受那种痛苦和失望，但尝试去看看那次损失是如何真实帮助你的。</p><p>THIS POINT OF VIEW OF BEING SERVED by your experience is something you must cultivate. It does not justify the experience itself. Understand this. It merely gives you an opportunity to use your experience for your advancement and your empowerment. Truth operates in the world of illusions to help those who are responding to truth in their lives. You are responding to truth or you would not be undertaking this program of development. Thus, you have arrived at the juncture where it seems that the truth competes with other things and is, therefore, very hard to recognize. In this program of development, the truth will be distinguished from everything else in such a way that you can experience it directly and will not be confused about its appearance or its beneficial existence in your life. For the truth is here to serve you as you are here to serve the truth.</p><p>这种从经验中获得服务的观点需要你培养。请理解，它并不为经验本身辩护。它只是给你一个机会来利用你的经验来提升自己并增强自己的力量。真理在虚幻的世界中运作，以帮助那些在生活中回应真理的人。你正在回应真理，否则你不会开始这个发展计划。因此，你已经到达一个似乎真理与其他事物竞争的节点，因此很难辨认。通过这个发展计划，真理会与其他一切区分开来，以便你能直接体验到它，并不会对它的出现或它对你生活的有益存在感到困惑。因为真理在此是为了帮助你，就像你在此是为了帮助真理。</p><p>PRACTICE 27: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习27：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This is its only possible value. We do not condone error, but if error occurs, We wish to make it serve your truest need so that you may learn from it and repeat it no more. It is not merely for you to forget your errors, for you cannot do that. It is not merely for you to justify your errors, for this will make you dishonest. It is not merely for you to look upon your errors as pure service to you, for they have indeed been painful. What this truly means is that you recognize that error is error and then you attempt to use it on your own behalf. The pain of error and the tribulation of error must be accepted, for this will teach you what is real and what is not, what to value and what not to value. Using your error for development means you have accepted the error, and now you are attempting to utilize it to derive value from it because until value is derived from error, it is error only and will be a source of pain and discomfort for you.</p><p>试图为错误辩护是没有意义的，但错误可以引导你去珍视真理，从而导致真实的内识。这是它唯一可能的价值所在。我们不赞同错误，但如果错误发生了，我们希望让它为你真实的需求服务，以便你能从中学到，并不再重复。你不仅仅是为了忘记你的错误，因为你无法做到。你不仅仅是为了为你的错误辩护，因为这会让你变得不诚实。你不仅仅是为了将你的错误视为纯粹为了服务于你，因为它们确实是痛苦的。这真正意味着你认识到错误就是错误，然后你试图为自己利用它。错误的痛苦和错误的磨难必须被接受，因为这将教会你什么是真实的，什么不是，什么值得珍视，什么不值得珍视。将你的错误用于发展意味着你已经接受了错误，现在你正在尝试利用它来获得价值，因为直到从错误中获得价值，它只是错误，将为你带来痛苦和不适。</p><p>TODAY, IN YOUR TWO 30-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIODS, look at specific errors that you have made that have been very painful. Do not try to dismiss the pain of them, but see how in your current circumstances in life you can use them for your own benefit. Using errors in this way can show you what you need to do and what corrections or adjustments need to be made to enhance the quality of your life. Remember that any resolution to error always engenders true recognition and true discernment in relationship.</p><p>今天，在两次30分钟的练习中，回顾你所犯过的具体错误，这些错误曾让你非常痛苦。不要试图忽略它们带来的痛苦，而是看看在你当前的生命中，你如何利用这些错误来获得自己的利益。通过这种方式利用错误，可以展示你需要做什么，以及为提高生活质量需要进行哪些纠正或调整。记住，对错误的任何解决方案都会在关系中带来真实的认知和真实的辨别力。</p><p>IN YOUR PRACTICE PERIODS REVIEW THE ERRORS that come to mind as you sit quietly alone, and then see how each one can be utilized to your current benefit. What needs to be learned from them? What must be done that was not done before? What must not be done that was done before? How can these errors be recognized in advance? What were the signs that preceded them and how can such signs be recognized in advance of error in the future?</p><p>在练习中，回顾你独自静坐时浮现出来的错误，然后看看每一个错误如何能对你当前的情况有所帮助。从中需要学到什么？以前没有做过的事，现在需要做什么？以前做过的事，现在不该做什么？如何提前识别这些错误？它们之前有哪些迹象，如何在未来的错误发生前识别这些迹象？</p><p>USE THESE PRACTICE PERIODS for this introspective process and when you are done, do not speak of the results to any other person, but allow the investigation to continue naturally, as it naturally will.</p><p>将这些练习用于自省，当你完成后，不要与任何人讨论结果，让这种探索自然地继续下去，因为它会自然而然地继续。</p><p>PRACTICE 26: Two 30-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习26：两个30分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It is something that must be experienced, for no great truth can be contained in an idea alone, though ideas may reflect it within your current experience. Great truth is a product of great relationship. You hold a great relationship with life. You hold a great relationship with your true Teachers who are within you. Eventually you will experience great relationship with those in your outer life, but first you must experience the source of your great relationship in its true establishment already. Then it is a matter of merely transferring it to the world outside, which you will do naturally in time.</p><p>生命最伟大的真理是什么？它是必须要经历的，因为任何伟大的真理都不能仅仅存在于一个想法中，尽管想法可能在你当前的经验中反映出它。伟大的真理是伟大关系的产物。你与生命有着伟大的关系。你与存在于你内心的真实老师们有着伟大的关系。最终，你将会与你外在生活中的人建立起伟大的关系，但首先你必须已经经历了你伟大关系的源头的真实建立。然后，只需将其自然地转移到外部世界，这在时间上你会自然而然地做到。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS, practice feeling this relationship. Again you are asked to receive because you must receive this to give it. Once it is received, it will give of itself naturally. In the process of this your worth is re-established because it is quite apparent. You do not need to misrepresent yourself or your experience. To share a great love honestly means you must be experiencing it. It is this experience that We wish to give you today.</p><p>在你的两个练习时段中，练习感受这种关系。再次，你被要求去接受，因为你必须先接受它才能给予它。一旦它被接受，它将自然地给予自己。在这个过程中，你的价值被重新建立，因为它是相当明显的。你不需要歪曲自己或你的经验。诚实地分享伟大的爱意味着你必须正在经历它。我们今天希望给你的就是这种经验。</p><p>PRACTICE 25: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习25：二个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

In fact, you really are God’s love. Without pretense of any kind, at  the very core of yourself, this is your True Self. It is not the Self you yet experience, and until you do experience it, do not pretend that this is your experience. But hold in true awareness that this is your Self. You are a person, but you are greater than a person. How can you be unworthy of God’s love if that is what you are? Your Teachers surround you and provide that which you are so that you may experience yourself and your true relationship with life.</p><p>你确实是值得上帝的爱的。事实上，你确实就是上帝的爱。毫无假装，就在你的核心深处，这就是你的真实自我。这不是你目前经历的自我，直到你真正经历它之前，不要假装这就是你的经历。但要真正意识到这就是你的自我。你是一个人，但你比一个人更伟大。如果你就是这样，你怎么会不值得上帝的爱呢？你的老师们围绕着你，提供你所需要的，这样你就可以体验自己和你与生命的真实关系。</p><p>IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, practice receiving once again the love, support and direction of your Teachers, and if any thought obstructs this, if any feeling prevents this, remind yourself of your great worthiness. You are worthy not for what you have done in the world. You are worthy for who you are, where you have come from and where you are going. Your life may be filled with errors and mistakes, wrong decisions and poor choices, but you have still come from your Ancient Home to which you will return. Your worthiness in the sight of God is unchanged. There is only great effort to repair your errors so that you may experience your True Self so that it may be rendered into the world.</p><p>在今天的两次练习中，再次练习接受老师们的爱、支持和指引，如果有任何想法阻碍了这一点，如果有任何感觉妨碍了这一点，请提醒自己你的伟大价值。你的价值不在于你在这个世界上做了什么。你的价值在于你是谁，你从哪里来，要到哪里去。你的人生可能充满了错误和过失，错误的决定和糟糕的选择，但你仍然来自你的古老家园，你将回到那里。你在上帝眼中的价值不会改变。只有付出巨大的努力来弥补错误，你才能体验到真我，从而将真我呈现给世界。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR PRACTICE PERIODS, practice receptivity and experiencing true worthiness. Let no thought conflict with the greatest truth of life.</p><p>因此，在你的练习阶段，要练习接受和经历真实的价值。不要让任何想法与生命中最伟大的真理相冲突。</p><p>PRACTICE 24: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习24：二个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This idea may challenge existing ideas or beliefs, but it is true nonetheless. God’s Plan is invisible and recognized by very few because very few have the openness of mind and the quality of attention that will allow them to see what is obviously occurring around them, which at this point is not obvious to them at all. Your Teachers love you, surround you and support you, for you are emerging into Knowledge. This calls them to your side. You are one of the few who has the promise and the opportunity to emerge from the sleep of your own imagination into the grace of Reality.</p><p>这个真理将会在你准备好的时候显而易见，但现在可能需要极大的信念。这个想法可能会挑战现有的观念或信仰，但它仍然是真实的。上帝的计划是无形的，只有极少数人能够认识到，因为很少有人同时拥有开放的心智状态与高度集中的注意力，使他们能够看到周围显而易见的存在，而这在此时对他们来说根本不明显。你的老师们爱你，围绕着你，支持着你，因为你正在进入你的内识。这召唤他们来到你身边。你是少数几个有希望、有机会从自己想象的沉睡中走出，进入现实世界的人之一。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE PERIODS TODAY, feel this love, support and direction. It is a feeling. It is not ideas. It is a feeling. It is something you must feel. Love is something you must feel to know. You are indeed loved, surrounded and supported by your Teachers, and you are very worthy of their great gift to you.</p><p>因此，在今天的两次练习中，感受这份爱、支持和指引。它是一种持续的感觉。它不是想法。它是一种感觉。这是你必须感受到的。爱是你必须感受到才能知道的礼物。你确实被老师们爱着、围绕着、支持着，你非常值得他们给你的伟大礼物。</p><p>Practice 23: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习23：二个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You cannot yet see them with your eyes, and you cannot yet hear them with your ears because these faculties of sense have not been refined sufficiently yet, but you can feel their presence, for their presence surrounds and protects you. In your practice, let not other thoughts interfere. Do not give in to doubt or confusion, for you must prepare to have the reward that you seek, and you must know that you are not alone in the world to have the strength, the confidence and the resource of wisdom necessary to achieve that which you were sent here to achieve.</p><p>今天，在两个15分钟的练习时间里，感受上帝之师的存在。你还不能用眼睛看到他们，也不能用耳朵听到他们的声音，因为这些感官能力还不够完善，但你可以感受到他们的存在，因为他们的存在围绕着你，保护着你。在你的练习中，不要让其他想法干扰你。不要屈服于怀疑或困惑，因为你必须为获得你所追求的奖赏做好准备，你必须知道，在这个世界上，你并不孤单，你有力量、有信心、有必要的智慧资源来实现你被派到这里来实现的目标。</p><p>YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY THE TEACHERS OF GOD.

This right must be earned and comes later if you wish for your judgments to have true effect and to be wise.</p><p>在第三次回顾中，复习过去一周的所有课程及其结果。今天的练习中，不要作出任何结论，只需认知发展路线并记录你到目前为止取得的进展。现在做出真正的结论还为时尚早，尽管你可能很想这样做。初学者没有能力判断自己的课程，这个权利必须赢得，而且如果你希望你的判断真实有效并且明智，它会在以后出现。</p><p>THEREFORE, IN YOUR ONE PRACTICE PERIOD, review the last section of practice and all that has been experienced thus far.</p><p>因此，在这次练习中，复习上一阶段的练习以及到目前为止所有的经验。</p><p>PRACTICE 21: One 45-minute practice period.</p><p>练习21：一个45分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

You have a greater goal which is being illustrated in this program of preparation. Do not let doubt and confusion be an obstruction to you. To be a true student means that you are assuming very little and that you are directing yourself in a manner that you do not prescribe for yourself but which is given to you from a Greater Power. The Greater Power wishes to raise you to its own level of ability. In this way, you receive the gift of preparation so that you may give it to others. In this way, you are given that which you cannot provide for yourself. You realize your individual power and ability because they must be developed in order for you to follow a program of this nature. You also realize your inclusion in life as life strives to serve you in your true development.</p><p>除了你自己的犹豫不决，还有什么能减缓你的进展？而除了让心智混乱的东西，还有什么会引发犹豫？你有一个更大的目标，这个目标在这个准备计划中得以展现。不要让疑虑和困惑成为你的阻碍。成为一名真实的学生，意味着你假设很少，并且你以一种并非自定的方式引导自己，而是从更高的力量那里得到引导。这种更高的力量希望提升你的能力到它的水平。通过这种方式，你获得准备的礼物，这样你也可以给予他人。通过这种方式，你得到你自己无法提供的礼物。你认识到自己的力量和能力，因为它们必须发展起来才能让你遵循这样的计划。你也认识到你在生命中的角色，因为生命在努力服务于你的真实发展。</p><p>THEREFORE, PRACTICE THE SAME PRACTICE that you attempted in the previous day in your two practice periods, and do not let doubt or confusion dissuade you. Be a true student today. Allow yourself to concentrate on your practice. Give yourself to practice. Be a true student today.</p><p>因此，在今天的两次练习中，继续进行前一天的练习，不要让疑虑或困惑阻碍你。今天做一名真实的学生。专注于练习，投入练习。今天做一名真实的学生。</p><p>PRACTICE 20: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习20：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It too requires a refinement of your mind’s faculties. To see with clear vision means you are not seeing with preference. It means that you are able to perceive that which is actually occurring rather than that which you wish to see. There is something actually occurring beyond your wishes. This is very true. The desire to see, then, is the desire to see a greater truth. This requires a greater honesty and a greater openness of mind.</p><p>看见的渴望就像知道的渴望。它也需要对你心智能力的提升。清晰地看见意味着你不是用偏见去看，而是能够感知到实际发生的现实，而不是你希望看到的现实。实际上有一些事情正在发生，超出了你的愿望。这是非常真实的。看见的渴望，因此，是看见更大真理的渴望。这需要更大的诚实和更开放的心智。</p><p>TODAY IN YOUR TWO PRACTICE SESSIONS, practice looking upon one simple mundane object. Do not take your eyes off of that object, but look and practice looking very conscientiously. You are not trying to see anything. You are simply looking with an open mind. When the mind is open, it experiences its own depth, and it experiences the depth of what it is perceiving.</p><p>今天在你两次的练习中，练习注视一个简单的平凡物体。不要把目光移开，而是仔细地看，认真地看。你不是要试图看出什么，而是以开放的心态去看。当心智开放时，它会体验到自身的深度，也会体验到它所感知关系的深度。</p><p>CHOOSE ONE SIMPLE OBJECT THAT HAS VERY LITTLE MEANING for you and gaze upon it twice today for at least 15 minutes. Allow your mind to become very still. Breathe deeply and regularly as you gaze upon this object. Allow your mind to settle down into itself.</p><p>选择一个对你而言没有太大意义的简单物体，今天注视它两次，每次至少15分钟。让你的心智变得非常安静。注视物体时深呼吸，保持规律的呼吸。让你的心逐渐平静下来。</p><p>PRACTICE 19: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习19：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It is not merely an idea; it is not merely an image, though images and ideas may accompany it. It is an experience, and so it is something that is deeply felt. It may manifest in slightly different ways for those who are beginning to penetrate it, but nonetheless it will arise. It is something you must feel. To have a feeling orientation, your mind must be still. Truth is something you will feel with your entire body, with your entire being.</p><p>真理必须被完全体验。它不仅仅是一个观念；它不仅仅是一个图像，尽管图像和想法可能伴随着它。它是一种体验，因此是深刻感受到的经历。对于那些开始触及它的人来说，它可能以略有不同的方式显现，但无论如何它都会升起。这是你必须感受到的经历。要有感觉的定向，你的心灵必须静止。真理是你将用你整个身体、你的整个存在来感受的体验。</p><p>KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT SPEAK TO YOU AT EVERY MOMENT, but it always holds a message for you. To come into the proximity of Knowledge means that you become more and more like Knowledge itself—more whole, more consistent, more honest, more devoted, more concentrated, more selfdisciplined, more compassionate and more self-loving. All of these qualities are developed as you approach that which is the source of these qualities.</p><p>内识并不是在每一个时刻都对你说话，但它总是为你保留一条信息。接近内识意味着你变得越来越像内识本身——更完整，更一致，更诚实，更投入，更集中，更自律，更有同情心，更自爱。所有这些品质都是在你接近这些品质的源头时发展起来的。</p><p>IT IS IN THIS DIRECTION THAT YOU WILL PRACTICE moving today as you feel the truth arising within yourself. This will join all aspects of you, giving you a uniform experience of yourself. In your three 15-minute practice periods, give your full attention to feeling the truth arising within yourself. Practice in stillness, and do not be discouraged if it is difficult at first. Simply practice and you will proceed.</p><p>正是朝着这个方向，你将在今天练习，感受你内在升起的真理。这将联合你的所有方面，给你一个统一的自我体验。在你的三个15分钟练习时段中，全神贯注于感受内在升起的真理。在静默中练习，如果一开始感觉困难，不要气馁。简单地练习，你将会前进。</p><p>THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS WELL, without doubt or hesitation, pursue your true goal in life. From this true goal will come all of the important things that you will need to accomplish and the great power of vision and discernment that will allow you to find those individuals that you have come into the world to find.</p><p>在整个日子里，也要毫不怀疑或犹豫地追求你生命中的真实目标。从这个真实目标中，将来所有你需要完成的重要事情和伟大的视野与辨识力，这将使你能够找到你来到这个世界上要寻找的那些人。</p><p>PRACTICE 18: Three 15-minute practice periods. </p><p>练习18：三个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

Developing the ability to hear and the desire to hear will yield to you that which you seek. The truth is utterly beneficial to you, but at first it can be quite shocking and disappointing to your other plans and goals. This you must risk if you wish to have the certainty and the empowerment that the truth will bring to you. The truth always brings resolution of conflict, always provides an experience of self, always gives you a sense of current reality and always provides direction for you to move forward.</p><p>渴望听到真理既是一个过程，也是真实准备的结果。发展听见的能力和听力的欲望将使你获得你所寻求的内识。真理对你极为有益，但起初它可能会令你的其他计划和目标感到非常震惊和失望。如果你希望拥有真理带来的确定性和授权，你必须冒这个险。真理总是带来冲突的解决，总是提供自我体验，总是给你一种当前现实的感觉，总是为你提供前进的方向。</p><p>TODAY, IN YOUR THREE 15-MINUTE PRACTICE PERIODS, practice listening to the truth, trying to listen beyond the mind and emotions. Again do not be concerned if all you hear is the rushing about of your own thoughts. Remember, you are developing listening. That is the most important thing. Like exercising a muscle in the body, you are exercising the faculty of mind called listening. Therefore, this day practice listening, taking these practice periods to devote yourself so that you may feel the truth arising within you.</p><p>今天，在你的三个15分钟练习时段中，练习聆听真理，试图超越心智和情感去聆听。再次提醒，如果你听到的只是自己思想的喧嚣，请不要担心。记住，你在发展聆听的能力。这是最重要的。就像锻炼身体中的肌肉一样，你在锻炼称为聆听的心智能力。因此，今天练习聆听，在这些练习时段中全身心投入，以便你能感受到真理在你内在的升起。</p><p>PRACTICE 17: Three 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习17：三个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

From this True Self come thoughts and impressions, inclinations and direction. Most of what your True Self communicates to you you cannot yet hear, but in time you will learn to hear as your mind becomes still and as you develop the necessary refinement of listening and discernment.</p><p>在你心智之外的是内识，你存在的真实核心，你的真实自我，不是你为应对世界而构建的自我，而是你的真我。从这个真我而来的是思想和印象、倾向和指引。你的真我传达给你的大部分信息你现在还无法听见，但随着时间的推移，随着你的心灵变得平静，以及你发展出必要的聆听和辨识的精细化，你将学会聆听。</p><p>TODAY PRACTICE IN THREE PERIODS OF 15 MINUTES EACH. Listen more carefully than the day before. Listen for deeper inclinations. Again you must listen without judgment. You must not edit anything. You must listen deeply so that you may learn to hear.</p><p>今天进行三个各15分钟的练习时段。比前一天更仔细地聆听。聆听更深层的倾向。再次，你必须无评判地聆听。你不能编辑任何内容。你必须深入聆听，以便学会听见。</p><p>PRACTICE 16: Three 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习16：三个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

This true content wishes to express itself in the context of your current life and current situation. To discern this you must listen carefully and in time realize the difference between the true content of your mind and its messages for you and all the other impulses and wishes that you feel. To separate thoughts from Knowledge is one of the great accomplishments which you will have an opportunity to learn in this course.</p><p>“今天我会聆听我的体验，找出我心灵的内容。”要意识到，你心灵的真实内容隐藏在你出生以来所添加的一切之下。这个真实的内容希望在你当前的生命和现状中表达它自己。为了辨识这一点，你必须仔细聆听，并最终认识到你心灵的真实内容及其对你的讯息与你感受到的其他冲动和愿望之间的区别。将感想与内识分开是你将在本课程中学习到的伟大成就之一。</p><p>THE ONE PRACTICE TODAY OF 45 MINUTES will be devoted to inner listening. This will require that you listen without judgment of yourself, even if the content of your thoughts is disturbing. Even if the content of your thoughts is disagreeable, you must listen without judgment to allow your mind to open. You are listening for something deeper than the mind, but you must go through the mind to get there.</p><p>今天的一次练习，持续45分钟，将致力于内在的聆听。这将要求你在聆听时不对你自己进行评判，即使你的感想内容令人不安。即使你的感想内容令人反感，你也必须不带评判地倾听，允许你的心灵可以打开。你在倾听比心灵更深层的内识，但你必须通过心灵才能到达那里。</p><p>Practice 15: One 45-minute practice period.</p><p>练习15：一个45分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

We do not give it here as an affirmation but as an expression of your current state. You want to be separate because this defines your self; your self is defined in terms of separation, not in terms of inclusion. Separation is the source of all your pain and confusion of mind. Your physical life demonstrates a separate life but only from a certain point of view. Given another point of view, it does not demonstrate separation at all. It demonstrates a unique expression of a Greater Reality.</p><p>这个想法代表了分离的真实动机，但它是不必要的。我们在这里不是把它当作肯定，而是作为你当前状态的表达。你想要分离，因为这定义了你的自我；你的自我是根据分离来定义的，而不是包容。分离是你所有痛苦和心智混乱的源头。你的物质生活表现出独立的生活，但这只是从某种观点看。从另一个观点来看，它根本不表现出分离。它展示了更大现实的独特表达。</p><p>ON TWO OCCASIONS TODAY, spend 15 minutes concentrating upon the idea for today. Think seriously about what this lesson means and call upon your own experience to reflect upon its relevance to your life. Reflect upon what your desire for separation has cost you in time, energy and pain. Realize your motivation for separation and you will know that you want to be free.</p><p>今天两个时机，花15分钟集中思考今天的想法。认真思考这一课的意义，并调用你自己的经验来反思它与你生活的相关性。反思你对分离的渴望在时间、精力和痛苦上付出了什么代价。意识到你分离的动机，你将知道你想要自由。</p><p>PRACTICE 13: Two 15-minute practice periods.</p><p>练习13：两个15分钟的练习时段</p>]]></content>

It is quite apparent that you are made of the same “stuff” as everything else around you. What is mysterious is your mind. It seems to be a distinct point of understanding, but it is as much a part of life as your physical fabric. You are an individual unaware of your Source and your total inclusion in life. Your individuality is a burden now, but it will be a great happiness to you when it can express life itself.</p><p>不管建立在你个性之上的巨大建设，以及与你个人相关的一切——你的身体、你的观念、你的困难、你的特定表达形式、你的特质、你的才能——你都不是与生命分离的。如果你简单地看待自己并意识到你身体的构成、你物质生活的织物完全是由物质生活中的生命组成的，这一点是显而易见的。很明显，你是由你周围一切相同的“物质”构成的。神秘的是你的心智。它似乎是一个独特的理解点，但它与你的物质结构一样是生命的一部分。你是一个不知道自己源头并在生命中完全包含的个体。你的个性现在是一个负担，但当它能表达生命本身时，它将给你带来巨大的幸福。</p><p>PRACTICE 11: Read the lesson three times today.</p><p>练习11：今天阅读这个课程三次</p>]]></content>

It is not ideas. It is not a body  of information. It is not a system of belief. It is not a process of self-evaluation. It is the great mystery of your life. Its outward manifestations are profound intuition, great insight, inexplicable knowing, wise perception in the present and in the future and wise understanding of the past. But despite these great achievements of mind, Knowledge is greater than this. It is your True Self, a Self that is not apart from life.</p><p>让我们说内识不是通常与之相关联的那些事物。它不是观念。它不是一套信息。它不是一个信仰系统。它不是自我评估的过程。它是你生命中的伟大奥秘。它的外在表现是深刻的直觉、巨大的洞察力、难以解释的知晓、现在和未来的明智感知以及对过去的明智理解。但尽管这些是心智的伟大成就，内识比这更伟大。它是你真实的自我，一个不与生命分离的自我。</p><p>PRACTICE 10: Read the lesson three times today.</p><p>练习10：今天阅读这个课程三次</p>]]></content>

Why are you doing this anyway? Why are you asking such questions? Why do you seek for greater things? Why are you exerting the effort? These questions are inevitable. We anticipate them. Why are you doing this? You are doing this because it is essential. If you wish to live anything greater than a purely superficial and unstable life, you must penetrate deeper and not be confident based only upon weak assumptions and hopeful expectations. There is a greater gift awaiting you, but you must prepare yourself mentally, emotionally and physically. Without Knowledge, you are unaware of your purpose. You are unaware of your origin and your destiny, and you will pass through this life as if it were a troubled dream and no more.</p><p>很好的问题！你为什么要这么做呢？你为什么要提出这样的问题？你为什么寻求更伟大的知识？你为什么要付出努力？这些问题是不可避免的。我们预料到了它们。你为什么要这么做？你这么做是因为这是必要的。如果你希望过上超越纯粹表面和不稳定生活的更伟大生命，你必须深入探索，不能仅仅依赖脆弱的假设和希望的期望而自信。有一个更伟大的礼物在等待你，但你必须在心理上、情感上和身体上做好准备。没有内识，你就不知道你的目的。你不知道你的起源和命运，你将像经历一场困扰的梦境一样度过这一生，仅此而已。</p>]]></content>
